1,1,Shoes came USED & ABUSED!These shoes came out of the box FILTHY! Not new AT ALL. I paid TOO MUCH MONEY for a shoe that someone else has OBVIOUSLY been running around in & that is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!,0,0
2,1,"I haven't worn these on a real regular basis because they kill my feet if I wear them too often. Even so, 6 months after buying them I dug them out of the back of my closet today and I noticed the stitching is coming out on the toe of my right shoe.I had hoped to find a comfortable, high quality walking shoe and I expected to pay a higher price to get that. What I got was the higher price tag and an inferior product.",0,0
3,1,"I’m an Airmax fanatic, love the style and comfort and I haven’t been disappointed in the past. However, the quality of the latest pair I ‘treated’ myself to has completely deteriorated! I’ve had the pair for 8 months and I’m sorry to say that they have ripped and my feet get wet if I walk on a wet floor.. very very sad! I haven’t ‘abused’ the shoes in anyway. I’m scared to purchase a new pair Incase the same thing happens. They weren’t cheap and I expected them to last for years! As my previous pairs have in the past.",0,0

5,1,"I don't know if they are fake or not, but after years of buying Nike sneakers (even for running), I bought my first Air Max in 20 years, and I had to give them away. They were really hurting my ankle so bad that I couldn't walk the next day.",1,0
6,5,"Very comfortable shoes!! I've always wanted a pair of air max 90 essentials just never got a pair. I've never been so excited about getting a pair of shoes and anxious at the same time from reading reviews about sizing and knock offs and whatnot. They looked awesome online and I really wanted them! I got them today and they are definitely the real deal! Not some fake knockoffs at all. I know what to look for and these are 100% legit. Mine were purchased from the seller sneakermaniany so thank you sneakermaniany for making this a smooth transaction and for not selling fakes. I highly recommend this seller. You might be able to find them a little cheaper from other sellers but knowing they'll be at your door quick and knowing they're real is worth the extra money to not have that worry. I'm 31 and I was like a little kid again opening these shoes. Definitely worth buying. They feel great, are true to size and look amazing. Get yourself a pair!",0,1

20,4,"Many complements. They kind of turn my socks blue like fake Nike's so a tad bit concerned about paying full price, but the build and glue lines are good and do not indicate any fakeness. Overall currently still my favorite shoe pair in my arsenal.",0,1

22,1,"These are way to narrow to wear. To bad ,I really liked them",0,0
23,1,They are nice and original. The only reason why i gave it 3 stars was that the left shoe was creasedI switched from 3 stars to 1 star. The crease on the left shoe got really bad on the first wear. The leather started lifting up kind of forming a small bubble ....cheap,0,0

25,5,"I bought these back in the 90s and loved them!! When I saw they were brought back I couldn't order them fast enough. Nike fits me strangely. I have to order a half size up. With Adidas, I can order an 11 every time, but Nike is always an 11.5. Maybe that's just me but wanted to tell everyone.",0,1
26,5,I love my shoes. They are so comfortable 🙂 I saw some pictures of some of our people shoes and they look terrible they got to be got to be kidding me ain't no way Amazon sold someone shoes looking like that. I bought air Max 90 they was up legit! And I been wearing for over a year and they still look brand new!!!,0,1
27,1,"I was considering buying these shoes for a while and last year I finally bought them and I was very dissappointed with them. For my taste, they are ""very narrow"" and once you put and additional insole, they become very tight which it makes them unbearable and I have normal width fee!. I paid $100 for them and now they are just collecting dust. I don't reccomend them...",0,0
28,4,I still have my Nike Airmax and they're looking just as great as they did when I bought them I'm an O.G. Older Gentleman so I'm not hard on shoes and unfortunately I'm not running any marathons either I bought them because they go great with a decent sweatsuit and or jeans,0,1

31,5,"Have had this as a pin on Pinterest for over 5 years and thought I would never find them! Now everybody looks at them, no matter where I go! These are beautiful, well fitting, and comfortable shoes",0,1
32,5,"Fits great, looks great. I'm not a runner but I wear these in a casual setting or when going to the gym/fitness studio. It's very comfortable and well-built. I'm not a shoe person but I like this so much that I'm planning on getting another pair.",0,1
33,5,This shoe was beautiful and exactly what i wanted. Just that 13 didnt fit it like some of my others . But i have had plenty over the years that were a tad too tight. Had they been only $120 i would have squeezed my toe in it,0,1
34,1,"Crappy fit, not comfortable at all. Would not recomend",0,0
35,5,Honestly this was the most I've ever spent on a pair of shoes ($250) but as the old saying goes you get what u pay for. Nowadays that tends to not be so true anymore. These shoes however were extremely well made..very stylish and the only issue which isn't a big issue for me was comfort. Not so back that I'd end up with blisters but uncomfortable enough to invest in shoe inserts.,0,1
36,4,I did not like the color of the shoe because the picture of the shoe made them look orange but when i got the they are more a burnt orange like almost a red. Other than that they are cool. This is why I give it 4 star. Man if the would of be orange they would of been so awesome oh well,0,1
37,1,Product is not as described in the picture. Bought black with white writing in certain areas. And ended up with black with white writing all over snd plastic looking. Sent them back immediately.,0,0
38,1,"I purchased these shoes less than a year ago. I have an exorbitant amount of sneakers, so this is certainly not due to wear and tear. I simply soaked these in Oxy Clean, as I have with MANY other Nike shoe products, for a few hours and this was the end result. While this will not deter me from purchasing Nike products now or in the future, I respectfully request a replacement pair.",0,0
39,5,"Overall, the quality is good. My foot is kinda wide so they scrunch my feet up a little more than I'm used to..nothing uncomfortable, just snug. I don't plan on wearing these often so I'm happy with these overall. My girlfriend loved them but they didn't have em in her size.",0,1
40,4,Comfortable and great quality for the price. Fits as expected. Good price point for the product.,0,1
41,3,I have always like how these shoes look. But after buying my first pair I won't but anymore again shoe was very narrow and uncomfortable by the middle of the day.,0,0
42,5,I had a pair of these before and they are awesome. I have flat feet so it's hard to find shoes that don't kill my feet since I stand all day at work and these are perfect once broken in.,0,1
43,1,These shoes are incredibly uncomfortable. I have ordered a number of these same shoes in the past and never had a pair that was so painful. There are sharp protrusions on the inside of the shoe and they are impossible to wear at all even to try to break them in. I have been trying to break them in but they are just too painful. I want to send them back please.,0,0
44,4,"We went a half-size up but it wasn't enough. Had to go a full size up. My boyfriend had to take out the soles for the fit to be bearable.Note, he does have slightly wide feet but has never had this issue with any other shoe.",0,1
45,1,The back of both shoes broke and popped the air in 2 days of simple walking on flat surfaces.Then the nylon above the toe area turned cream colored in 2 days and wasnt near any dirt or water.Dont waste your time unless it's for a one time wear.,0,0

47,2,One shoe fits good the other not!,0,0
48,1,"The quality of the product so badly,cheap and poor. Most likely cheap chinese fake. The foots all the time sweating (This means that the sneakers do not breathe) and according to this you get smell, also I use sneakers just one-two times per week. After 4 month you can see on pics what happened( the shoe sole peeled off) I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!!!!!!",1,0
49,4,"Everything about this shoe I love! The only reason its not a 5 star is because out the box the shoes had some scuffs/imperfections. But, not anything i'm too worried about. Would recommend!",0,1
50,5,I love these sneakers! Love the bright green and they are super comfy.Going to buy another pair on payday.,0,1
51,1,"Terrible. They are fake af and I've learned my lesson. Don't buy from other sellers. Even if it has a reasonable price, don't do it. It's best to buy it from a legitimate source like Foot Locker, Champs, etc or just buy it in person.",1,0

60,1,Shoes were so stiff and skinny I could barely get my foot in it ... I went up a half size and knew immediately once I tried to insert my foot I would have to return ... they weren't even close ... and now I have to pay five dollars to return them like it's some kind of scam with the Wrong size tag sewn in so you have to pay 5 bucks,0,0
61,5,"Only thing is I was required to sign for the package, and I didn't know that. So it took a while to be able to make it to the post office to pick it up, since I'm at work everyday with nobody at home to sign for it. That should just be made more clear when ordering. But great product!",0,1

184,1,I recently purchased a pair of all white air max 90's and I am completely disappointed with the quality of the shoes considering the fact that the leather from the right shoe on the toe began to lift up and wrinkle after the first wear which did't happen with the left shoe. This makes me question the authenticity of the shoes considering the fact that I have purchased air max 90 shoes before and this has never happened even after years of wearing them. I do wish to get a refund for my money back due to the fact that these shoes do not hold up to the quality that nike endorses.,1,0
