20,20,4,"Well, i would give these earphones a 5 star rating. but the only problem or the issue i see was the packaging they arrive in.The earphones work perfectly fine in terms of sound quality and seems to me very authentic Apple earphones.Having discussed the issue about packaging to the seller, they informed me that the earphones come in this e-commerce packaging and apparently claiming it to be bona fide Apple product.As long as the product is working fine, I am good.4 stars only because of the packaging but i believe thats the reason for the product being low cost.",0,1

To them I say that they are wrong. This is indeed An apple product, as shown in the images. The product is not bad but if you miss handle the headphones they will break.If they came broken, then it is a shipper / distributor issue and you are likely due a refund.I’m not an apple fanboy but these headphones work well for facetime and casual use.

I’m too afraid to use anymore in case it gets stuck in my iPhone or just destroys it. $25 is not cheap to waste. Thank you to Amazon for the refund.",1,0

27,27,4,"Ocean reef electronics advertised these as refurbished . They are just plain used . They have actual ear wax in each of the four ear buds (I purchased 2 pair). The cords are dirty and grey, the seams around the volume control and earbuds are black with filth. They look like mine normally do after a couple months use which is nice enough but this is some strangers ear wax and nastiness . Not refurbished at all. So gross .",1,1
28,28,2,"I bought these after a lot of debating. I read the reviews, which were very mixed. Several of the people also commented on feeling concerned about ordering from this seller, but decided to give it a try with a good outcome. So I thought I would also take the chance. BAD CHOICE on my account! The product LOOKS like a Apple product. The came in the usual Apple box, which was sealed, and was packaged exactly the same. They appear brand new, are clean with no viable damage. HOWEVER...., although I can hear just fine through these earbuds, the person on the other end complained of muffling, breaking up, or not hearing anything at all. All within a space if a minute, with no change in location or position. THESE ARE NOT A AUTHENTIC APPLE PRODUCT. They did not state that they were reburbished either. So even if they were, to sell them as a NEW item and in a sealed APPLE box was misleading! DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER! I don't know where they are getting this product, but it is NOT worth your money or time. It was a waste for me, and now I STILL need to buy another set of earbuds in order to handle my calls. VERY ANGERING and disappointing!! WHATEVER HAPPENED TO COMPANIES (Amazon and others) holding up to the best possible standards and making sure their customers are buying from the best?! As usual..., it's always about the money...., whether it AMAZON, another company, or one of their seller's....., the standards have gone out the window and consumers are on their own.",1,0
29,29,1,I took these out of the packaging and they appeared cracked. And they are.

I gave them to her in mid January 2019, and they stopped working already, after less than a month! Seller would not take them back.

Would NOT buy again.",1,0
34,34,1,"You can tell right off from the labeling on the box that doesn't match real EarPods. Then you open the box and there is no case for the EarPods - they are just wrapped around a piece of cardboard. Then you look and the volume control is in the wrong spot and not the right color. The plastic is cheap and lightweight, especially apparent in the flimsy plastic wires. The piece of plastic that wraps around the manual and warranty is actually made of paper. Just Google ""how to tell fake earpods"". These will fail every single test. And two weeks later, they are already broken.",1,0
35,35,1,"The left ear pod stopped working after just one month of use. I should have listen to the other reviewers. When they were working the sound was great from them. When walking on a treadmill or going for a light run they would bounce out of the ear and would need to be pushed back in all the time. I would not buy these if you are going to do any fast walking or more.Update:So after three tries with the EarPods I finally just received a full refund from Amazon. On all three EarPods the left one stopped working right around after a months time. Two stopped working after the return window with Amazon however the Amazon Product Support Expert I chatted with was great. The first two times they sent me a new pair, and this last time they were still able to provide a refund.Do not buy this product.",0,0
36,36,5,"I bought two sets of these to replace the Apple-brand earpods that came with my and my wife's iPhones. She lost hers, and mine got caught on a gate latch and pulled a kink in it that I expected to short out any day. It never did, but that one has now been ""promoted"" to reserve set, and I've been using these earpods ever since. They were branded as Apple items, and after a very close inspection, I could find nothing that told me otherwise. They work fine, and they are very comfortable. I have worn these earpods for more than 10 hours a day while traveling, and they felt just as good at the end of the day as they did at the beginning. No soreness in my ears, which has been a problem with other earbuds.",0,1
37,37,1,"The EarPods that I received, had average sound quality and were comfortable. However there were two major problems that came with mine. Within the first week of usage I noticed that the volume buttons did not work. While this was a disappointment it wasn’t a dealbreaker so I did not return them. After less than a month of usage, the second major problem occurred when I found that the end of the Lightning cable was corroded.(Photo) The EarPods are now essentially useless, since every time I plug it to my phone I can’t hear anything from them. Overall I’m really disappointed that this product had only one month of real usage.",0,0
38,38,1,"So disappointed in these earphones. I purchased them in April, and figured since it’s an apple product then should be good. Price was good, so little skeptical to begin with. When they arrived they looked like genuine apple product, and worked fine for first few months. Then one side stopped working, and other side made crackly sound. Was hoping these would last longer than a few months. When they did work, they worked pretty well, but can’t give good rating, as didn’t last long.",0,0

41,41,1,These earbuds didn't last one week! The very tip of the plug end stayed in the phone when I went to unplug it. I had to get a pliers to get the piece that was stuck in my phone!

42,42,1,These looked like OEM headphones and came packaged as new however after two songs they quit working.

44,44,5,"I didn't know what to expect when I saw the lower price and the horrible reviews trashing these EarPods. My previous EarPods (from Apple) had broken from the usual wear-and-tear from the gym and had become unusable. I wanted to buy a new pair but wasn't keen on overpaying for the EarPods that were at the Apple Store for $30 or so. I'm glad I took a chance and got these - they work great and I've used them for over a couple months. No problems with the connection and the sound is clear when loud and high quality. It would be nice to move into the realm of wireless EarPods, but these are easy to store without losing or misplacing. Highly recommend because of the sound quality and ease of use.",0,1
45,45,5,"They're definitely Apple EarPods and work great. I needed a new pair as I gave my old one away to a friend who needed them and used Mpow bluetooth headphones instead but the Apple EarPods are amazing to use for phone calls so I wanted to get a new pair and these are perfect. All the reviews saying they're ""fake"" are either really old reviews (I can't speak for back then), fake reviews, or just have no idea what they're talking about.

46,46,5,"Some of the reviews on here caused me doubts at first if these were the real deal (since it’s a gamble with Amazon sometimes to avoid getting knock offs). But I ordered them despite those reviews.They arrived and appear to be the real deal. I bought two sets of these and compared them to the originals that I had gotten with my iPhone. You can’t tell them apart.They look, sound and operate in every way - these are authentic Apple Ear Pods with the Lightning Connector.

47,47,3,"While I really like the actual pod design of the headphone, (can't stand the rubber headphones in my ear) these are not the longest lasting pair of headphones. I bought this current pair Feb 19, 2019 and they stopped working yesterday 6/21/19. I don't know if it's just because I use my headphones every single day.

49,49,4,"If you’re reading this, you’ve probably lost or broken (like me) a previous set of EarPods, so you ought to know what you’re getting. The EarPod design is still a huge improvement over the old rounded earbuds, and are easily wiped clean or dabbed with a cotton swab. The proprietary Lightning Connector pin fits securely enough that if you fumble your iPhone, the pods are more likely to pop out of your ears than out of your iPhone. The audio is good, and the volume/button/microphone works consistently. I wish that the wiring was more durable, but considering the price of AirPods, and that most other third-party earbuds would have to plug into the 3.5mm to Lightning adapter, there are no other affordable, easy options for iPhone hands-free users.I saw that some other reviewers had trouble recieving dud sets or no EarPods at all. The photos here are to attest that I was shipped a legit Apple product.",0,1
50,50,4,"These headphones are good — I mean, it’s Apple for goodness sake. They’re high quality for the most part (sound/noise cancellation) however, the headphones have a tendency to break within a few months. The lightning cord attachment that connects the headphones to the iPhone ALWAYS detaches off of the headphones and gets stuck in the iPhone charger area. I think it’s because the headphones don’t have a sturdy wire... it’s just thin plastic. Other than that, they’re good. But keep in mind that paying for new headphones every three months (after the lightning cord breaks) adds up quick! That’s about $80+ a year on 4+ headphones bought.",0,1

By the time I finally got them (3 days after), I’d already bought more at the Apple store and used them for a couple of months before they shortened out (haven’t been lucky with the last couple of these I’ve bought strangely enough, usually the original ones last me until my next phone upgrade and still work, I just usually get rid of them); which is why i couldn’t return them.Honestly at first I thought I had damaged them... but the box was in perfect condition when I took them out and do were the EarPods.

My purchase of this item was at a discount (of $10) from Apple's list price, but even the full price purchase would have been worth it. Don't mess around with the 3rd party items. They're just not worth it. This item is definitely the way to go. Works cleanly and sounds great.Compared to what you'll shell out for the wireless earbuds, these are a great deal (and you never have to worry about charging them). Great product, but just to repeat, make sure you buy directly from Amazon.",0,1
59,59,1,"Absolute trash. Right out of the box, the mic only worked properly when inserted on a specific side in the lightning port. I marked that side with a marker and didn’t really care too much about the mild inconvenience. Fast forward 3 weeks and the mic is getting worse to where the other person on a phone call can’t even hear me speak. It’s trash. I am convinced that this is not an actual Apple product.

It is clearly marked with Apple’s etching of “Designed by Apple in California Assembled in Vietnam” with the model number and a 12-digit serial number at the end of this text. This clearly is proof that it is indeed an authentic Apple product. This makes me feel really good in knowing that I’m only using genuine accessories with my genuine Apple iPhone. The sound quality is amazing with just the right amount of bass level to really emphasize the music but with out drowning out any other tones. To me, there just isn’t anything better than the kind of sound quality you get in genuine Apple EarPods for listening to music. The features on the remote is an added bonus and really makes navigating through my music list so much easier as well as answering. I really love it",0,1

62,62,1,"Wow I believe it was a real apple product. Within a week And a half one bud stopped giving sound. Two weeks it gave out completely, both sides. How would you put a apple stamp on somthing that feels cheaply made. Your money is worth more than two weeks. When they did work you could still hear your surroundings. Sound was okay, just okay. Microphone buttons actually gave out the first week. I want a refund and so will you. What a disgrace to put a apple logo on this. It’s not really apple. I have the original ones that came with my phone and sound better and everything works. Apple is built toLast. Products like this make Steve Jobs turn in his grave",1,0

The first pair lasted a few months then one of the speakers popped out - was still connected & could be popped back in but it was a bit of a hassle doing it all the time.

74,74,1,"I had these headphones for less than 4 days. They did not sound good at the start. There was a little static mostly when I clicked the bar in the center to adjust the volume. There were some slight marks on the cable upon opening the package and I thought maybe it was normal and would straighten out but I did not look closely, I used them twice for maybe 15 mins each use. I was not impressed and they hurt my ears. Last night I fell asleep with them next to me I planned to listen to some music or make a call but I was too tired, when I woke up the long part of the cord was broken in many places. I have fallen asleep with other headphones before, put others in my backpack and purse and they have been fine for years. These would not have survived. I have never seen a cable break up like this before. I called both amazon and Apple customer service, amazon customer service first.Amazon was very slow and after they said I may get a refund upon return.Apple could not replace this product. They could not even verify these are legitimate Apple products because after reading every number on the box and the number printed on the cord they said none of those numbers were the serial number that was needed. Apple customer service also mentioned the reason that the cord could have broken up like this is because of improper storage from extreme heat or extreme cold.These headphones were recommended to me by a close friend who I trust, they said these are good quality and I believed him, (he has the much more expensive cordless version) it might be worth mentioning there was also no noise cancellation as my friends mentioned or bass as the customer sales rep mentioned there should have been when I did hear sound from them.The amazon customer sales rep had me try them in my ears even with the exposed cord which did not seem safe. There is no sound. The amazon sales rep mentioned he has these same headphones and that I should “try them again” or maybe he “just got lucky” with his. I am very dissatisfied and disappointed.

Since they were outside of the four week window for returning to Amazon I was told to go directly to Apple to see if anything could be done under the warranty.

Both times the case would not charge using a Mophie charging pad. I finally gave up and just plug it in to charge. The other problem with this device is that the left Airpod does not charge consistently. Probably due to the tolerances in the charging case being off. I stuck a piece of paper in the slot to make a tighter fit. Sad - Apple are you listening?,0,0

Apart from that, being plugged in means no charging and although Airpods are said to have fast charging speeds, they also supposedly lose that charge just as fast.

Amazon also removed the scammers of that by the next day and now it is properly a 1.5 star item. Maybe you can get more expensive brands that sound better, but from reading the real reviewers, it seems that every type of earbud is prone to breakage.

Not like the pics, I did not have this ""bursting"" effect, but i was able to easily scrape it off after about 5-10 mins.Instructions:1. Take a nail file or a buffer and buff off the top clear layer a little (can be patchy if using a file but try to scrape off the majority of the top layer, a corse file works better for this)2. Brush on a THICK layer of the gel coating the nail entirely.~*~ Wait 5-10 mins, don't touch!- I like this better than having foil wrapped fingers cause you can still do stuff so the time goes fast~*~3. Take a metal cuticle pusher and scrape from cuticles up towards tip of nail.

IF - on the infinitesimal chance - what I have here is not legit, then they represent a flawless, masterclass in forgery, and are still worth every cent. Either way, I'm very happy.Side note: I've used noise-cancelling and sound-isolating headphones before, but I really think that EarPods - which have neither of these features - have a solid place. It's often a real advantage to be aware of my surroundings while enjoying music, podcasts, or whatever.

Not only does it come with the Apple warranty I’m the box but it also has the apple serial number of the product so it can be verified. The price for these right now is also really similar to price on Best Buy and Target as well. Good headphones only ones that I can use with my lifeproof case. The only thing is that you have to have them in your ear in a kind of weird way because of the new design.,0,1
243,243,3,They work fine BUT they will stop playing music and you have to unplug them and plug them back in and they will work fine again. I honestly forget what triggers it but working out with them is frustrating at times. I think it’s when you hit pause. I don’t think they’re real apple headphones.,0,0
244,244,3,Purchased item in May and by August the headphones didn’t work and kept going in and out with static. The product wasn’t damaged it just didn’t work as well,0,0

246,246,1,I wish I never orders these and just went to Apple I’m only writing this because I know or a fact I’m not returning them I don’t feel like going to a mail box but I bought them the same day I bought a separate pair from amazon that broke the same hour I first used them I need headphones for work so I immediately just decided to buy the real apple ones they came in the next day I went into work and put them in within 5 minutes one stopped working and it never did again waste of 20 bucks if you ask me.,1,0

384,384,5,These earpods are actually Apple earpods I didn’t have no problem with them the sound was terrific and it will last long.......my EarPods didn’t because it got caught in the door but if it wasn’t for that they still would have been working,0,1
385,385,5,The only thing I hated about this item was paying almost $30 for the first set than a week later they were cheaper.,0,1
386,386,5,"Mine didn’t work when I received them, but they shipped me a replacement either the next day or the day after. These work great.",0,1
387,387,5,You can always rely on the original apple headphones to deliver quality. Had to reorder after my first pair wore out.,0,1
388,388,2,"Loved these for 3 months but remote has glitches and now it sounds like a record that skips, like it can’t decide if it is going to pause or not. Disappointing.",0,0
389,389,5,Apple is very particular about their accessories. If you’re not careful you will buy a pair of headphones that look exactly like what they should but they will have poor sound quality. These are the original headphones and the price it’s a great value. considering that you pay about $35 at the Apple store. Great product great value.,0,1
390,390,1,After one week of use they just broke from the lightning connector. Wasnt really worth the money.,0,0
391,391,5,"I wish these would last forever, but they don’t. Still a pretty good product. Mine were authentic Apple.",0,1
392,392,4,"Good for listening to music, but have heard from numerous people that on a phone call I sound under water.",0,1
393,393,5,All 3 pair I ordered everyone loves them!,0,1
394,394,5,As expected,0,1
395,395,5,Exactly like the ones that came with my iPhone 7. Original Apple product. Good sound and mic works well for calls.,0,1
396,396,3,"I ordered three of these since I tend to misplace them. After two or three months of using them, my iPhone XR no longer works with one of them. So I guess 1/3 not bad, but since they cost near the same as the Apple ones, just buy those.",0,0
397,397,4,"It’s iPhone 7 earbuds. It would be nice if they also came with an adaptor by default, but I’m not Apple am I. They’re great if you have an iPhone 7, but I would imagine they are completely useless otherwise.",0,1
398,398,3,These fit well. The sound is good. But if the connector is somehow knocked then it goes into pause.,0,0
399,399,4,"Hasta ahora no se malogra. No le pongo cinco estrellas porque no me gusta el color blanco, y además porque los empleados de Apple fueron muy groseros conmigo cuando fui a comprar estos mismos audífonos a uno de sus establecimientos. Naturalmente no los compró allí porque nadie me quiso atender.",0,1
400,400,5,Nothing to complain about!,0,1
401,401,5,Arrived on time and they were brand new in original package. And they were cheaper than original price 😊,0,1
402,402,3,"They’re definitely not apple, but they work and they sound quality isn’t terrific but it’s clear and it gets loud. Haven’t had them long enough to say whether they last or not. Also, they arrived 6 days before the time period I thought I was going to get them.",1,0
403,403,5,Just what was expected of product,0,1
404,404,3,"Bought these for my son. Started out great, but he is already complaining they are not working as good when first bought.",0,0
405,405,1,"These earbuds are NOT approved by Apple. While they worked well enough to listen to music, they were TERRIBLE when it came to holding a phone conversation! All callers reported a loud crackling noise and said my voice sounded far away. I immediately ordered from an approved vendor. These headphones are NOT GOOD. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR!",1,0
406,406,2,These aren’t real apple products. The wire feels cheap and the sound quality is not comparable to real apple headphones. Do yourself a favor and spend $10 more to get real ones that work better and will last longer.,1,0
407,407,5,Hard to keep in my ears as have small ears but good sound and good for phone calls. Don’t have to scream to be heard.,0,1
408,408,5,Searches the cheapest I could find these are perfect. I wish I didn’t keep losing them tho.,0,1
409,409,3,They don’t look like the original EarPods I had with my phone. The quality of the sound is definitely not the same as well.,1,0
