It is best to use immediately after you wash your face, especially after a shower when skin is soft and moist and pores are still open. I wish I had this during my teen years!! Highly recommended!!!

1,1,5,"Okay so I bought this and I was expecting the worst. To my dismay I was totally wrong! It was already charged and ready to go. I should say that before I did this I placed a hot towel on my face for about 5 minutes. Anyway, I don’t know how anyone could use this on any setting other then the first because the suction is very strong! Not unbearable but perfect!! I did my nose and chin and the junk that came out was SO gross! I didn’t use on my entire face because I don’t see the point in it other then my problem areas. Anyway... I love this product and want to purchase one for my son as well. Or maybe for anyone I know lol. If you are on the fence about this like I was just DO IT!! My skin is also so soft after use.

It’s way better than the masks I will use !!! Try this !! Don’t leave it on just one spot move it around slowly I do it down my nose and move my way up and wow so much comes out !! I recommend this !!!",0,1

20,20,5,"I was really skeptical about this because I've seen the ad on facebook a million times. Thought it was just a run for money like usual. But I was wrong!!! I used this as soon as it came in the mail. I took a shower to open up my pores and then did what the instructions said, and oh my goodness!! The crap that came out of my nose was insane. I've always had a huge problem with blackheads, especially on my nose!!!! My nose has never felt smoother and I can already see the difference in the color of my pores. My husband used it as well and it actually bruised his nose slightly and not ""a lot"" came out, but I think that's only because he didn't steam his face long enough to open his pores. I definitely recommend taking a shower first before using. I highly recommend this product for blackheads. As far as acne goes... I have a lot of open acne sores and it kind of hurts to go over them, so I'm not too sure how well it works for acne itself. But for the nose, it's really good!",0,1
21,21,5,This product works super great for a home spa product!,0,1
22,22,4,"I just received this blackhead remover today. Great packing, nothing broken. Very strong suction (but adjustable), great instruction book which covered all the questions I had- how long to leave on skin, where to begin on face and which direction to pull toward and what each adapter suction was for. Basically before care and aftercare instructions. It will leave some redness and tingling to skin which is understandable because of blood circulation but they also inform you that it will go away from half an hour to 24 hours. Depending on your skin. You are not to use it more that 5 minutes on your face at a time and should use only twice a week. Overall I love this new facial gadget. Although it did not remove the deeper blackheads on the first time it did however, bring them to the surface. I didn’t want to continue to suction as I could see the redness on my face and didn’t want to make it worse. You can take them out manually if they are that superficial or wait until the next use to get them out. But for the most part it removed a lot of whiteheads that were clogging my pores and left my face feeling lighter and smoother after one use. But again some of use may have more blackheads/white heads and acne than others. So results will vary I’m sure. It also comes with a battery charger (cord). The only reason I didn’t give this 5 stars is because of the bigger blackheads I was unable to remove on the first time. But for the price and great packaging and extra items it has I would definetly recommend!",0,1
23,23,5,The blackhead remover vacuum arrived beautifully packaged in a nice box with the 3 extra attachment heads presented along with the usb charging cable. It powered up immediately of the box to my surprise so I was able to use it right away. Being slightly nervous about the suction power I triedIt first on the back of my head to see what it felt like. It was very easy to use and after one swipe on the hand I was ready to begin. Following the instructions included made the process simple and without complications. I chose a middle setting because the higher levels seems a little too strong for my skin. When I was done I removed the head and rinsed it under the sink to clean it and let it air dry for the next use. Very useful tool to have and will get a lot of use.,0,1
24,24,5,"Pros:- Nice professional packaging- Simple to use, make sure to read the instructions! Prevent yourself from getting a Hickey/bruised spot!- Powerful suction- Extracts oils and exfoliates skinCons- It may not extract the full blackhead, but parts of it does extract out.Tips: Don't forget to open up your pores with facial steam, warm towel or simply while taking a shower wash face with hot water. Don't let the suction stay in one spot too long, it's powerful and move it around.",0,1
25,25,5,I have always wanted a suction cleaner and I finally took the plunge! Poppyo has great suction power and I am already seeing noticeable changes after one use.I am excited to see how continue use of the product effects my skin and I hope to update my review with positive results.,0,1
26,26,3,"I like how there are different suction sizes and different suction settings. I was looking for a product to remove blackheads, specifically on the sides of my nose. I think it worked to remove a few, but it was difficult to use in the crevices on the sides of my nose and not very effective. I tried using more suction power and didn’t have much luck and it hurt a bit. I could only use the lowest and second to lowest setting without it hurting.",0,0
27,27,5,I love this productIt really worksIve always thought I cleaned my face properly For the most part I have a really good skin .after using this product my skin felt so soft I had a glow .. I do recommend buying a face streamer .. it will open ur pores and the suction works better,0,1
28,28,5,"You don't realize how much oil accumulation your nose has or even your face. I've been meaning to get something like this because I usually push my two thumbs/fingers etc. together to force whiteheads out of my nose with a combination of a tweezer. This just does it a lot more elegantly with probably lesser skin damage. This comes charged, but it may not be a bad idea to charge it up some more. It warms up quick and you get a few modules to utilize for slightly different purposes. The top heads are very easy to put on and off, and are interchangeable. The packaging is nice and the instruction manual is actually detailed. The product itself is pretty self explanatory but for ~$30, it definitely does the job of removing blackheads, whiteheads. Your skin will get warm pretty quick so just make sure to keep that in mind when you use the item.",0,1
29,29,5,"Works great! I really like using this product to help clear up my face! Make sure to read the directions and use the interchangeable head that suits your face! It works best if you steam your face before using it, or use it after a shower. Do not leave it in the same spot on your face for more than 3-5 seconds or you could give yourself a hickey like bruise! :) great product!!",0,1
30,30,5,Wonderful better than expected!!,0,1
31,31,5,I've seen so many ads for these pore vacuums and I had to give it a try. I don’t have terrible skin but the pores around my nose could use a little help. They have always been tough to clean out and this definitely helped with it. Start on a lower setting because you could easily give yourself small hickies,0,1
32,32,5,"I was a big fan of the squeeze and pop, my wife never has been, so I am sure you can guess one of my favorite “Dr” shows is. So no more messy mirror to clean and a lot less painful. Great Product.",0,1
33,33,5,"My 17 year old daughter had some acne issues, so I bought her this to help clean her pores. It works great and is easy to clean.",0,1
34,34,5,"I don’t know if this device removed blackheads or not, but it opens my pores nicely, I like to use it then wash with rub big alcohol before bed and my face feels much cleaner after adding this to my routine.",0,1
35,35,4,"I recently just ordered the blackhead pore removal vacuum and tried it out for the first time.It comes very neatly packaged and with several different head sizes, which I can definitely appreciated. When deciding to try mine out I washed my face as regularly and used hot water to open my pores. I then decided to try out the vacuum. It has several different suction settings and I suggest using the higher settings. When using the setting though you have to continuously move it, if you suction in one place it will most likely bruise your skin. I decided to use it on my nose and chin, as that's where my pores are the worse. On my chin it seemed to work pretty well and looking at my vacuum, there was quite a bit a grime on the inside. (Use a qtip to clean it out quickly). Now on my nose it did not work as well. I will admit though that the pores on my nose are always stubborn and I've tried everything before already. I then moved onto below my eyes. There it didn't seem to get stuff out of my pores necessarily, but it definitely was getting rid of dead skin and some other grime on my skin.Overall I would say that it doesn't ""pull"" everything in your pores out. It does though get junk off your skin. I would suggest if you have sensitive skin or more dry skin this is not the product for you. If you have more oily skin, hen this is your tool!I will update in couple weeks after using it more and add pictures!",0,1
36,36,5,I love this! So easy to use even my 13 year old was able to operate it. After using it your face has a little tingle you can feel it working. As long as you follow directions there are so many uses for it,0,1
37,37,5,I like the fact that it is for different types of skin. It comes with extra suction probes and it is rechargeable and easy to use I love it so much that I added it to my night routine .,0,1
38,38,5,I really appreciate the multiple heads you can switch out. That makes it go from 3 stars to 5! With the different heads you can really get everything. It also makes it really easy to clean.,0,1
39,39,5,I purchased this product because I have oily skin and after reading reviews felt I needed to give it a shot..I normally would go to the salon for a microderm treatment but felt if this works I could save money. I'm glad that I got it and was pleasantly surprised at the difference it made being an at home treatment. Got rid of all the whiteheads in my chin...Make sure to moisturize following.,0,1
40,40,4,"This little vacuum does work. It does clear out your blackheads. It's kinda gross when you see what you take out of your skin. I won't post photos because its gross. Anyway, I was going to give it 3 stars, but it does work, so I'll chalk it up to my sensitive skin. Make sure your face is washed and moisturize before using it. If you have sensitive skin your skin will just dry out and flake. At least thats what happened to me and I do have sensitive skin. Use soap like Shea Moisture's African Black Soap, moisturize, then use this. You skin will be a bit red, but it will go away and you will have a smooth clean face. You can also use it after using an at home microdermabrasion machine. The point being, clean your face, try to get everything you can out of your pores and use this for those stubborn blocked pores.",0,1
41,41,5,I’ve had this for a while and figured it was time to review.This product works great. And has a wonderful suction. MAKE SURE YOU READ INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW DIRECTIONS. I cannot stress that enough lol. Otherwise you’ll look like you have mini hickies everywhere hahaha,0,1
42,42,5,It did what it was suppose to do,0,1
43,43,1,"Unlike many of the other reviews for this thing, this one is real. The suction on this thing is way too powerful for one. It gave me hickies and red marks all over my face. Not only that but it did not even remove my blackheads or goop. I tried it with a dry face and then steamed my face just to make sure I wasn’t doing it wrong. I wasn’t. It is awful for your face. I have purple dots on my skin from the first level of suction. Save yourself. Do not but it.",0,0
44,44,1,Cannot figure it out if doenst seem to do anything other than give me red marks.,0,0
45,45,3,"Unlike other users here I actually didn't have much of an issue with the suction. If you just keep moving it and don't keep it on one spot for too long you shouldn't have a problem. The only issue with regards to this is that I did have some redness the next day after using it, but I expected this and it wasn't anything that makeup couldn't cover up.The reason I did not give this more stars as I think overall this product is not great to use. It does help slightly with the blackheads on my nose however most of the time instead of fully getting the blackheads or whiteheads out it just rips party of it out which causes the area to get more irritated. Despite this it does what it is advertised to do and will suction out some of your blackheads/whiteheads. I just probably won't use this often as I have found it causes more problems than it helps.",0,0
46,46,1,"This tool, instead of cleaning my face, bruised my face and is unusable unless I want purple streaks on my chin, nose, and cheeks.",0,0
47,47,4,"Guys, I'm stunned! I was absolutely positive that this was a gimmick, but it isn't! I could cry because I'm so excited! I don't often get zits, but my skin gets blackheads pretty badly. Especially on my nose and chin. What you are seeing are empty pores! 👐👐 I had given up on this a long time ago and just accepted my fate.My skin is as bad as it gets right bowTo give this a fighting chance, I started by taking a shower so that my pores would be open. I started on my chin. I went all-in using the fitting with the largest opening and the highest suction level. This was probably the most successful area of my face. This is gross, but I could literally see sebum collecting in the top of the fitting.After that, I switched to the exfoliator fitting and did my nose. I have really small features, so it was kind of hard to get the entire opening of the fitting into my nose without gaps. I think this would be a lot easier if you have more surface area so the vacuum can work as it's intended. I was still able to get most of my nose, but the bridge of my nose is too small for this to work easily. Fortunately, I mostly struggle with blackheads on the sides of my nose so this wasn't too much of an inconvenience.There were a few stubborn places I had to help the device along by pinching the sebum out a little. This made it easier to vacuum out stubborn pores. I am kicking myself for not taking a before picture, but I honestly didn't expect to see results.There is a little bit of a learning curve, so I wouldn't recommend using this for the first time before you have to go somewhere. Guess who has a small hickey-looking mark on her forehead. 🙋 This is a total game changer for me and I hope it helps you too!",0,1
48,48,5,This product is amazing! I do not have an acne problem but I do get flare ups and I have had two black heads on my cheek for almost a year. I was getting facials once a month and they still weren’t going away. Within a week of using this product the black heads have dramatically decreased and my overall skin looks more fresh. I love this product.,0,1
49,49,4,I have quite a few black pores on my face and nose. I have been trying for a long time to remove them without drying out my skin. I used this blackhead remover after I took a shower since my pores open up a bit from the humidity and it did a good job taking out some dirt from the pores. I would say it does hurt a little if you used the highest level power like I did.,0,1
50,50,1,The device was just a disappointment. Was super excited with all the positive reviews. Upon opening the package it all made sense. There is a card for a $15 gift card for 5 star reviews.The device had fine suction but wouldn’t actually stay on long enough to do anything. The battery wouldn’t charge properly.Returned the device and opted to not get another.,1,0
51,51,5,"I bought this hoping to get rid of the black head on my nose along with a few white heads on my cheeks. The first time I used it, I didn't use a hot towel to open up my pores, so I was a little disappointment. The second time I used it, I used a hot towel on my face for 10 minutes. What a big difference. I no long have black heads on my nose and I almost got all the white heads on my cheeks gone. I also noticed that my skin was not as oily as normal for a couple days after. I do need the highest setting, so the first time I used this product I had what looked like a hicky running down my cheek, so it is important to move along with out staying In the same spot because the suctioning is powerful and will leave marks.",0,1
52,52,3,Not really sure about this product. I read really good reviews on it so I was very excited when it showed up. I used it three times for one week and made sure to follow the directions on the best way to use it. I still didn't get much luck. It worked a little just not as much as I was hoping. I have super oily skin so I was hoping it would do a little bit more for me but that wasn't the case. I'll definitely keep trying this product and find other ways to try and make it work with my skin.,0,0
53,53,1,"Works to remove dirt not blackheads. Worked a bit for white heads on nose. It bruised my face first time using it, only had it on for half a second and it bruised bad!",0,0
54,54,5,"This is the best thing I have purchased in my life!!! I have very clear skin except for my nose. For some reason my pores on my nose collects so much dirt and grime and it always oily. I take really good care of my face, buy expensive products and I have no complaints. My nose is just my issue. I got this on a whim and was thinking it never hurts to try it out. So I washed my face before thinking it really wasn’t gonna to do much. BOY I WAS WRONG!!! The amount of stuff that came out of my nose was so disgusting. It reminded me of an episode of Dr. Pimple popper. I have used it all over my face and it still does an awesome job. Gets things out that I can’t see. I have noticed a huge difference in my pores and my face is not as oily as before. My one advice is to make sure you don’t keep it long in one spot or you are gonna get a hickey. I’m thinking of sending one of these to my sister.",0,1
55,55,1,"Very strong vaccum, but it doesn't hurt. It comes with 4 different tips for different purposes. Also works good for massaging face. It also works great for ingrown hairs from Brazilian wax. It really does suck out blackheads. Has a bunch of strength settings. Comes with a exfoliating tip.i use it alot more than I thought I would. It doesn't hurt like when you squeeze them.Update:. Could be a little stronger for hard to get pimples. And maybe a catcher to make it easier to clean because stuff gets all over the suction screen. I wish the settings stayed the same when you turn off and back on.",0,0
56,56,5,My face feels completely reguvinated! Exfoliation to the max! No more black heads in sight. My makeup is going to look amazing on top of my skin now.,0,1
57,57,5,"I liked this product because it really has strong suction. Honestly, it felt like it didn’t pull out the blackheads at the root. But it really took out a lot of whiteheads. And it made my whole face feel so much softer. If you have really sensitive skin keep it on the lowest setting or if you’re a guy and can’t cover up blemishes and just pass it over your face don’t even wait three seconds pass it over your entire face quickly (then repeat the entire face, do not retreat any other area until you have done your entire face) that way you will get any blemishes and if you do you have what recourse you have the cold soda can method it fixes surface bruising like this in a few minutes. I hope you enjoy it’s worth the price and my skin feels a lot cleaner, softer and better . Buy it, it’s worth the money don’t go hard in any area trying to get any one thing out unless you really want the bruising other than that go gentle be patient one second over each little spot keep gliding it over as the directions show you and you will have awesome results. I’m very happy with how my skin looks and feels and I know you’ll be too without spending gobs of money.It’s totally better than sitting down with an extractor going after each pore and squeezing and pushing and the whole works this is a much simpler pass to fresh cleaner skin.",0,1
58,58,5,"I have never really had bad acne per say, but I saw this and decided to give it a try.It comes with interchangeable heads/suction tips for difficult parts of the face.I used it a few times on my nose, and definitely noticed and felt a difference.. it really is surprising how much stuff this actually gets out of your pores.You might want to start with the lowest setting to see your skin tolerance and then move up in intensity so that it does not irritate your skin.WORKS GREAT! RECOMMEND!",0,1
59,59,5,"I wish I could rate this 100 stars!This thing has absolutely changed my skin.I bought it with the hopes of it just clearing up my nose blackheads and honestly didn't expect much or really visible results.It has not only cleared my blackheads but has given me the best skin I've ever had. I wish I would have found this product 15 years ago!My pores are practically invisible now - And let me tell you I've had the worst blackheads all over my face since I hit puberty and nothing has ever helped...creams,washes, strips, masks, toner, you name it and I've tried it. The ones on my nose are still a little visible without makeup but only if you're very close and that's just my skin. I've also only been using this for 2.5 weeks though so they vanish completely still.Now beyond the blackheads; I've also always had terribly greasy skin. I mean like by noon, you could fry chicken on my face and I had to touch up my makeup constantly to combat the shine and not to mention it just feels so gross to be that oily.Well this product has erased that completely. I can go ALL DAY without having to blot or touch up my makeup due to oil and I'm still shine free.Now on to wrinkles... I'm still pretty young so I don't have many wrinkles but I was starting to notice deeper laugh lines. I spend a little extra time with this product on them and they literally are not there anymore. Not a trace of them.I barely have to wear any foundation anymore because of this product and I wake up and look like I'm wearing foundation because my skin is so smooth and clear.It takes no time at all to use either. I use it for 3-4 minutes after I get out of the shower at night.This thing is simply magical. Well worth the money and more.",0,1
60,60,5,I have some blackheads on my nose that I can never get rid of. I used this and I felt like it got alot out! I took a shower to make sure my pores were open then used this. I do feel like my face feels smoother and feels better after!,0,1
61,61,1,This product works amazingly! It has a strong suction and your face feels refreshed and clean. It does leave your face a little red afterwards but it clears up quickly. The massage ball is also nice and feels relaxing.It came almost fully charged but it charged completely in no time. It is also very easy to assemble the different heads.Update:I am still using this product and my face has never get more fresh and clean. I have had fewer breakouts and even less oily skin!,0,0
62,62,5,I was amazed at this product and how well it worked. I tried numerous pore vacuums and they have all been a disappointment. Not only is it rechargable (no batteries) the suction (even the lowest setting) was enough to get the dirt and oil out of my pores. Amazing product,0,1
63,63,5,"I was totally skeptical buying this. My aunt is an esthetician and shes used the salon machine in her salon to suction my blackheads before. She used diamond bits and whatever else, a procedure that no doubt costs a small fortune if I went to another salon to get it done. I decided to try this because I wanted something at home I could use whenever needed. Mainly it's for the blackheads on my nose. I am not disappointed. The machine is small, light, fits nicely in your hand. The led screen is super helpful in telling me the strength and battery life. The different tips are awesome, theres even a sharp scrubby attachment (similar to the diamond tipped one my aunt used). For my nose I used the small attachment. Within a couple of minutes I had gunk in the attachment and I wasnt using full strength. My face is a little red and swollen but it looks cleaner. I used witchhazel to wipe the suctioned area. I'm pretty pleased with this and I'm going to keep using it once a week to see if it makes a different. Overall I'd say 20 something dollars well spent.",0,1
64,64,5,"I use a lot of makeup for stage productions and it's hard to get all the muck out of my pores. I searched for a product that would be more effective than just facial scrubs and with more power so I gave this vacuum a try. Before writing this review, I wanted to try it for a few weeks to see the results and I have not been disappointed. I can really see the difference and my pores feel smaller and my skin smoother! I use it every 3-4 days to allow time for my skin to ""rest"" in between treatments. Very happy with my purchase!",0,1
65,65,2,"I am kinda torn with this product. The suction is very strong but it does not pull much out of your face. You can’t leave the suction in one place for too long because it will bruise your skin, even on the lowest setting. I have had this for a few months and you HAVE to steam your face beforehand if you want to get anything out. That being said, it still doesn’t remove any actual blackheads, just oil and dead skin. I’ve used all the attachments before and after showering, never one blackhead removed. It is nice to see all the dead skin and oil being removed though. Disappointing.",0,0

67,67,1,"I had a blackhead right on my cheek that I just could not remove. So when I got this product, i was very excited, I steamed by face to open my pores then gently used the product. But let me tell you, the suction power even on low is so strong that it bruised my skin. I think I probably left it on my skin for 1 sec. The spot turned red and started getting inflamed right away. By the late pm that skin area turned into a huge dark spot. I was livid. Totally ruined my face. This is not a good product.",0,0

69,69,5,"Update: I still am mostly happy with this, results aren't as impressive after regular use which is good, means it's working. But as you can see in the picture I went a little too strong on the suction and have literally lines of bruising down my chin...it doesn't hurt but it's ugly and reminds me to be careful around sensitive areas for breaking blood vessels...Wow I was pleasantly yet grossly surprised by how effective this was. I always avoid stuff like this because I always thought after a bad facial I had years ago my skin would erupt in whiteheads if I tried this....nope! The suction is great to get the job done but I did notice a little bleeding from the roughness of the suction but after I washed my face I didnt notice anything negative. My skin has felt smooth since and my pores I'm used to seeing on my nose and chin look smaller than ever. And yeah its satisfying to see all the gross that comes out, almost addicting",0,1
70,70,5,Great but BE CAREFUL! I do not recommend using this at any power higher than the second. And move it around and do not leave it in the same spot or you will give yourself a hickey. In my opinion the best way to use this is to sleep with on of those large hydrocolloid patches covering the area that you want to treat. Then when you wake up take the patch off and use this. Whenever I try to use this without using the patch first it doesn’t really work. But with the patch I’ve completely removed my blackheads with this thing which I’ve never done before. So much so that my coworkers have commented on how amazing my skin looks. I only use this thing on my forehead and nose as it’s tighter skin and therefore has less of a chance of getting suctioned and hickey-ed. IF YOU HAVE BROKEN CAPILLARIES OR ROSACEA DO NOT USE THIS! It will make your skin worse.,0,1
71,71,5,"I never had any issues with the size of my pores or blackheads until my late twenties and I just thought that they would go away on their own with being more religious with my normal skincare routine. I couldn’t have been more wrong. I then tried every strip and mask on the market to get rid of them and when I noticed very little difference I reverted to a metal blackhead extractor. Although it theoretically got the job done it also caused the skin in the areas I had used it to peel and the irritation would leave my Skin red and raw for sometimes more then a week afterwards. I had heard of“blackhead vacuums” but honestly thought it was a sham but finally gave in and bought this one after using my normal metal blackhead extractor caused the peeling on my nose to be so extreme that it was painful to the touch. I was shocked at how powerful this thing was. I was also disgusted by how much dirt and oil it sucked out of my skin that I couldn’t even see. I steam my face or use it straight after I shower to ensure all my pores are open which in my opinion is essential for this to work but I no longer have to deal with the peeling and irritation that I experienced with the extractor. And other then the slight bruising I get in areas where the skin is very thin I have no complaints. It’s easy to use, easy to clean and the charge on it is great. I would recommend this product to any of my friends and can already see a difference in the size of my pores. It’s been a god send to my skin.",0,1
72,72,4,"Before purchasing this I extensively read through the reviews. I was leery of purchasing because of the reviews that said he left bruising or red spots. My desire to try the product outweighed that, so I got it.I've used it several times and haven't had any issue with bruising or red spots. I've used it mainly on the lowest setting because I have sensitive skin. I wasn't able to extract anything from my pours, but my esthetician says that's because my pours are really good (even though I think they're not). I allowed someone else to use the product and it worked perfectly for them to remove blackheads from their nose and chin.I've used it daily for a week for fine lines around my eyes but have not seen a difference yet; I assume it will take some time (if it works) to show this. I'll up date this review if my findings change.",0,1
73,73,5,"I tried it right after delivery because I was excited. It definitely has good suction, but I didn't see the results I was expecting, although my wife noticed a small difference. I saw reviews suggesting a hot shower or steam first, so that night I did just that. Then I turned the device up higher, and actually followed directions. You put it on, and slowly kind of drag it across the area. I have had a field of gross whiteheads on my chin since my teens, and I'm in my mid-30s. I saw much better results! It didn't completely empty the pores, but it sucked out a serious amount of crap. Most importantly, I didn't have to pick at my chin or squeeze nearly as much. Years of doing this have given me fine little wrinkles in the area that my makeup sinks into and looks horrible. I've been using this a couple of nights a week now, and the whiteheads look smaller, and the skin there looks much plumper, healthier, and less wrinkly. It takes some maneuvering to get in the crease of my nose, but it works well there too. If you have the money, go for it. Easy to clean, too.",0,1
74,74,4,"They pay for 5 star reviews. Honestly I would have given the product a 5 star all on my own but it has lost suction so I have to put it on the highest setting and that's starting not to work. The product does honestly work to some degree. I would make sure your pores are open first. It's more effective. It half sucked out my blackheads mainly on my chin and cheeks. I've been using isopropyl alcohol to wipe the left over half sucked blackheads off and my skin has for the most part has been much more clearer. Unfortunately, I have a hard time with the attachment to be able to get the right angle to get to my nose. My pores are just as large as before but I have extremely oily skin and super large pores. Using this device does make my face red for a shot period of time but after using it I don't get any bruising, however; my suction is going out so... All in all, my skin is clearer and I love this little gaget but I'm disappointed that the suction is going out too soon. In my picture you can see all the gunk that came from my face after about 1 use. I hope you have better luck.",0,1

76,76,5,"I don't write many reviews but this one was a must. I had been a little doubtful of how efficient this would be but I was greatly surprised. my picture is a little gross but it shows how much crap it got out of my pores on the first use. I used it just on my nose since that is where all my dirty pores are. I have really sensitive skin and even with the highest power suction it didn't hurt my skin. the trick is to keep the suction tool moving really slowly and to do it several times over. if you keep it in one spot for too long it will cause a little redness though, but it went away. I did end up old school popping some stubborn black heads after using it but this thing definitely made them easier to clear out. and I would bet that if I hadn't done it manually myself that this thing would have eventually gotten them with continued use over time. I am super happy with the results after the first use and plan to make this apart of my nightly routine and I would bet that long term results will be amazing so I'm really excited about this little gadget.",0,1
77,77,1,"It works, really gets the ""gunk"" out of your face.Definitely has some suction power 5 different speeds and the 4 detachable heads are nice and easy to clean however it's kind of difficult to use on my nose especially in the crevices on the sides of my nose barely effective there. Also it works well getting the ""gunk""out, but not necessarily whiteheads. I'm pretty sure it helps get them out a little bit, but definitely pulls some dirt and oil out for sure. So in conclusion the detachable heads could be a bit better so they'd make it easier to do your nose and i don't know how but I'd like if it could target and remove whiteheads more effectively.",0,0
78,78,1,"Honest review: It did not remove blackheads. We tried putting a hot towel, and following instructions closely (which was poorly written by the way). We also tried to leave it on longer, like ten seconds, just for experimenting and it still didn’t get it out! Using a simple nose strip is more effective than this. Not worth the $30.",0,0
79,79,5,"I read a lot of reviews for this device before I bought it (I like to read negative first) but I felt like most complaints were skin related and since the price was so good, I purchased it. First of all, it came packaged in a nice box with a magnetic close lid which allows me to keep it stored inside which is super convenient! I read the instructions and was glad that it stated the purpose for each attachment. The instructions state that it should be used on a clean and dry face and after steaming your face to bring impurities to the surface. However, I was excited and used it on my face that still had makeup on it. LOL I could see it pulling stuff from my nose which was neat and it seemed to get some of the whiteheads on my chin (my worst issue). The suction was great and I was scared to use it above the middle setting. That night I showered and moisturized and tried again. This time it removed a ton and I could really tell a difference!! Definitely start with a clean and steamed face. It matters! It did cause redness but for me, it went away quickly. I have used it everyday for 3 days because it’s fun...although I know that isn’t good for my skin so I’m going to give it a rest. :P It came fully charged and the charge just went down one bar after 3 days and multiple uses (me and my husband). I feel like I have normal skin. Its not sensitive but I do have very dry skin so I made sure to moisturize the areas after each use. If you are wanting to try this after seeing all the reviews I think this one is a good choice. Love the price, suction, accessories, and packaging. Give it a go!",0,1

81,81,3,"This definitely has some suction power! I’ve used it a few times right after the shower to make sure my pores were open. The first time I got quite a bit of “junk” out, not necessarily blackheads. Which is what I was wanting it for. I’ve used it a few times since and barely anything is coming out. I have large pores and blackheads in my nose and chin, it maybe helped a little, but definitely pulls some dirt out",0,0
82,82,3,"This blackhead remover arrived fully charged and quickly removed my oil buildup. After just one use, my face felt really clean and smooth. The instructions, on the other hand, were terrible. I had to continually refer to them and still didn't find the answers I was looking, i.e, should I cleanse my face beforehand, should I use a facial steamer first, etc. The instructions referred to a filter and came with a rectangular piece of sponge and two addition gaskets (see picture). I thought the sponge was the filter but there were no instruction where it should go. I gave it a try anyway after which I noticed what I thought was oil buildup (beneath a plug under a probe) so discarded it. Upon reading some of the Amazon questions, I realized it most likely was a ball-shaped filter (see picture). Evidently, when that ball of filter needs replacing, you cut a tiny piece from the sponge. The instructions caution you not to stay on the same area of the skin too long, but the recommended 3-5 seconds was way too long for me--my face was still blotchy/red 12 hours later.Upshot: I like this product even though the instructions are terrible. I cleanse my face thoroughly every day, but it still managed to pull out some oil build up. First time users—especially teenagers—should be extremely careful. Once you get the hang of it, you’ll know how your skin will react.",0,0
83,83,5,"I'd always been a bit curious but skeptical about these types of beauty gadgets, but lo and behold this thing really can suck out blackheads! I could see the gunk that it took off my nose inside the little nozzle. It was easy to clean I just used a Q-tip. I was probably a little too aggressive with it and one of my pores showed a tiny dot of blood; so definitely follow the instructions and don't stay on any one spot too long. I was using medium suction power and even that felt pretty strong. I would also recommend doing this after a shower so your pores have opened up from the steam. Also it did make my skin pink (I am fair and have somewhat sensitive skin, like eyebrow waxing makes me turn pink as well) so I will only use this device at night so my skin has time to recover overnight. I hope that if I use this once or twice a week that my cleaner pores will eventually reduce in size but either way I wish I'd had one of these when I was younger and had greasier skin and acne. Just, vacuum your skin with caution cause this baby feels pretty powerful!",0,1
84,84,5,"I bought this to test before buying one as a gift. My boyfriend's sister had it on her xmas wish list, but I was a bit skeptical. My boyfriend said he wanted one too. So, I thought, why not just buy it to try it and if it works as advertised, then I would get one as a gift. Well, I read all the directions before using.....and YOU SHOULD READ THE DIRECTIONS BEFORE USING as well. It made it clear that you should not leave it in one spot for more than a couple seconds, otherwise you may end up with purpura (purple spots from internal bleeding, basically a hickey) on your face. You should start on a lower setting. I think it works well for cleaning pores on your nose and chin, increasing circulation, and exfoliating. I have very sensitive combination skin. I usually have dry cheeks and forehead through the winter season, so I have to exfoliate often. I believe the June Julien is a more gentle option than all of the facial scrubs. I use the June Julien once a week or every two weeks primarily to clean my pores on my nose and chin and as a supplemental for exfoliating with my konjac sponge. Love it.",0,1
85,85,4,"I bought this product with high hopes. I've had big pores in the t-zone and blackheads on my nose since being a teenager. Lately it feels like my make up doesn't look so good, because you can see clogged pores. I gave it a try right out of the box on a small spot. Didn't do anything. But I figured I should try it after a shower and exfoliating my face. I did that and moisturized and then tried it again. This time it worked pretty good. It didn't clean out the blackheads on my nose, but it did clean out a lot of my skin. I did have a couple spots that got a light hickey bruise despite feeling like I never just stayed in one spot long, but I also did it the first time on the high suction. I did it again a couple days later on medium suction. I felt like less gunk came out of my skin - but no bruising this time. I'm not really sure how it works for fine lines, but for cleaning out skin, it seems to do a pretty good job. I'm hoping that after using it consistently for a few weeks/months that it will help shrink pores and make my skin look a little smoother and nicer.",0,1
86,86,5,"I was surprised how powerful the suction of this tool was, and it definitely did what I'd expected it to do even though it took me a few minutes of trying to perfect the technique/movement of my hand to allow for suction. Once I did that correctly (there is a definitely a finesse to it), I could visually see what it pulled out...even when on the lowest setting. Basically, it felt like a combination of a microdermabrasian/extraction from a dermatologist/aesthetician for a tiny fraction of the price. My skin felt much smoother afterward and I will definitely use this once a month or so. I will say it's very easy to operate, but there are NO instructions on how to turn it on. It's very easy to hit the power icon, but it doesn't tell you that to actually have it start working, you need to press the buttons for up and down in order to generate the power you want it to operate on. So to clarify- power button for on/off, and arrows up and down for suction strength/to actually turn it on. I have already recommended it to a friend...I believe this is a ten times better return on investment than the Biore strips I used to place on my forehead, chin, etc.",0,1

Even though I’m a guy, I get a lot of blackheads every week due to the oil that get stuck inside my holes on my face and nose. This gadget sucks all the oil and blackhead in my face. My face feel so clean now and to follow up, I use serum and cream to close my holes on my face. I noticed the holes got smaller after I use this machine. It’s very power and strong. To me this gadget also helped me save some time instead of trying to squeeze all the blackheads with my nails previously. Overall, this machine was a great investment toward my face.",0,1

Let me start by saying that the first day I took it out of the package, charged it, and came back later to try it out...it would turn on, but not start sucking. I tried for at least 20 minutes by pressing the power button, then + button. NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN. I decided then and there I would return it. The next day, I came home from work and decided I would give it another go. I press power then + and it magically started working. I run upstairs, shower and wash my face, allowing the steam to open my pores, then I laid on the bed with a hot towel over my face to allow them to open even more. I turn the vacuum on, pressed onto my face, and slowly move it around. ZERO THINGS HAPPENED. Nothing came out of my pores. Returning and actually going to invest in an exfoliation tool.",0,0

I was a little nervous to try this as I didn't want to get bruised or red irritated skin, I have sensitive skin. I used the larger head at first on the lowest section which worked well. I had to switch to the oblong head to get the sides of my nose easier which also worked really well. It worked so well I forgot about the time limit and kept at it until I felt like all were gone. I applied essential oils before bed to my nose to help the healing in case there was any bruising or redness. It was slightly red the next day but nothing anyone else would notice. This has become a permanent fixture in my beauty tools now. No more buying strips and wasting money and adding to the landfills. This was also all charged to and ready to go upon opening.",0,1

My nose gets red after each use, but it definitely works and you can see the pores unclogging itself, so weirdly satisfying. I had been trying so many different exfoliators, tweezing tools to remove my white heads, and this is the easiest way of finally getting deep into those pores. My only issue is that after using it on the lowest suction level for 1 month, I dropped it on the bathroom floor and since then the suction hasn't been as powerful. I now have to put the suction at almost full power, it still works but not the same :(",0,1
92,92,5,"You will love this product! If your searching the reviews like I was looking to see if it was really powerful enough to suck to junk out of your pores then here is your answer... YES, IT IS! I bought this for personal use and I love it! You must use it correctly because of how well it works. If you leave it in one place for too long you will obviously leave marks because it pulls the blood to the surface of the skin like a hicky would. Always steam or use hot towels to open up your pores before use. My tip is steam, cleanse, steam again... use this machine to extract by going in grid lines from bottom to top. Grip the bottom of the skin and drag in an upwards motion. You want to keep it moving and leave it slightly longer (a few seconds) in trouble areas like the nose and chin. It will take a couple of times of doing this to clear out all of your pores if you wear face makeup daily... you want to cleanse daily make sure you’re removing all of your make up and do some exfoliation as well to remove the dead skin and allow the dirt and oils to be sucked out of the pores. Rinse with cool water to close the pores. 100% worth the purchase!",0,1

There are people out there that truly need this product; I am not one of them. As for the wrinkles, it was annoying to use for me (I'm lazy that way). So I returned it.

95,95,5,"I've been trying to get a bit clearer skin since I keep breaking out. My husband, on the other hand, always gets blackheads. So I saw this device and figured it would be great for both of us to use it. The blackhead remover vacuum is super easy to use. Just turn it on and adjust the suction to how high or low you want it based on your needs. There are several head attachments for various cleaning options. These are easy to change. Basically you just pull them off to switch them. In between uses, I do recommend cleaning them, especially if you are sharing your device with another person, to prevent spreading any bacteria. The suction is powerful and works very well. I find it doesn't hurt at all. If there is any discomfort then you may have too much suction. Lowering the suction strength will fix that issue. Very happy with the results so far!",0,1
96,96,5,"Used it for the first time, and i see a major difference. I washed my face with regular face wash ( no face scrubs before or after suction) and applied a warm/hot towel on my nose (main focus) for 3 minutes, allowing my pores to open. I then dried my face and hands and proceeded to use the blackhead vacuum. I held my nose with one hand and vacuumed with the other so i can have more control. I vacuumed from bottom to top. I also did my chin area. I will attach pictures of my nose before and after (forgot to take before and after of my chin) overall great product.

I could always see there was more to remove, or (in the case of the tools) was rather painful. I purchased this on a whim and the reviews, and I can’t express how pleased I am with this product. Be sure to read the instructions - there is a learning curve, as I’ve found out the hard way hahah (luckily, I received and tried it on a weekend - but I stayed too long around my nose which led to light bruising). Be sure to keep the vacuum moving across your face. The suction strength is more powerful than you anticipate so I would definitely suggest not starting at the highest setting. I use it immediately after I shower. I would post pictures of how effective this is, but would rather not and let you see how much it can clear for yourself.",0,1

I tried when my face was dry at first which was silly on my part def try when you get out of the shower and your pores are open and you won't be let down! So much gunk came out I'm shocked I just now started using this! Left my skin nice and soft with a noticeable difference in the amount of blackheads I had. It's super easy to clean as well, I preferred using a q-tip I was able to remove any excess super easily as I went along. The suction is powerful too so don't start off too strong at first. I LOVE it. Super happy with my purchase.",0,1

100,100,5,"This little vacuum does work. It does clear out your blackheads. It's kinda gross when you see what you take out of your skin. I won't post photos because its gross. Anyway, I was going to give it 3 stars, but it does work, so I'll chalk it up to my sensitive skin. Make sure your face is washed and moisturize before using it. If you have sensitive skin your skin will just dry out and flake. At least thats what happened to me and I do have sensitive skin. Use soap like Shea Moisture's African Black Soap, moisturize, then use this. You skin will be a bit red, but it will go away and you will have a smooth clean face. You can also use it after using an at home microdermabrasion machine. The point being, clean your face, try to get everything you can out of your pores and use this for those stubborn blocked pores.",0,1
101,101,5,"It's a good thing I watched some YouTube videos before using this thing, it really has the power to leave red marks if you aren't careful.The amount of blackheads and sebum on the nozzle is astonishing. You should expect to use this several times before you've completely cleared your pores of blockage and grime. Using it after a shower or after having a hot cloth on your face is a good idea. My wife and I also discussed that using a pore strip to take the plugs out of the pores, then using the vacuum would be a good combination and would give a deeper clean than either one by itself.On the wish list would be usb-c charging, but we can't always have everything.So glad we bought this one instead of the much more expensive one that the catalogs have, I can't imagine how it could be better.",0,1

104,104,1,"I've had blackheads on my nose ever since I was a young teen and thought I finally found the tool to help remove them, but sadly wasn't the case. This tool removed the tiniest amount of dead skin (that could be removed by using a washcloth) and nothing more. It didn't remove a single blackhead -- and considering that's the name of the tool, it should have at least helped a little. I followed the directions and opened up my pores by using a hot washcloth beforehand, but that didn't help. This was a complete waste of money and I regret purchasing. Planning to return so I can be refunded.",0,0

107,107,4,"Steamed my face, used exfoliating scrub, and dried face before using product to open pores. The suction power is strong, the 4 fittings you get really you only need 2 which is the fine lines oval fitting and the large. Small fitting is about same size as the oval, and the exfoliating fitting doesn't really exfoliate. Charger does not come with a plug only microusb cord.As for how well the product works, it will get rid of potential blackheads and white heads that have started forming, as well as some small shallow black heads pretty well. It should be looked at more of a preventative measure, I've had blackheads on my nose that keep popping back up after I get all the oils out, this product is good for once I get all the blackheads cleaned, they can keep them away with 2 times a week usage rather than having to push them out myself possibly causing damage to my skin and provoking new pimples.Too long didn't read? Worth the price to add to your skincare routine to keep blackheads away and unclog shallow pores, just don't expect it to clear all your white heads and blackheads.",0,1

I clicked on a random Facebook post about 30 things you'd didn't know you needed and... here we are.I have oily skin and have suffered from acne, black heads and HUGE pores for most of my life. Very little has improved any of these issues until a major diet change. Still, the black heads and huge pores remained an issue. While they weren't obvious from afar, they were super noticeable to me. I exfoliated and steamed my face before the first use and was amazed at what it removed. It wasn't as gross as I expected, but there was also a little learning curve/need to experiment. I've had this just a couple days short of a month and am obsessed. I use it about three times a week and have noticeable improvements to my pore size. It's night and day.I've recommended this to my sister and a couple of friends and they are also happy with their purchase. The battery lasts for many uses and once you get the hang of it, you'll be thrilled with your results.",0,1

But gosh I couldn’t believe how much stuff came out. I really wish we had gotten pictures but I had just put my phone on the charger and he flat out refused to take pictures because “someone could see”, teenage boys :eyeroll.

I have gotten smart and I use it correctly I don’t use it like these other people, That leave one star reviews. I was not paid to make this review either. I am just tired of spending money on face washes in facemask that don’t work. I use this on my nose, middle T zone, chin, because those are my problem areas on and it works!!! it’s not the perfect machine but I’m obviously not the perfect person because I have dirty skin I guess!😅❤️",0,1

Just be careful, the suction is really really powerful.I use the first level and it works perfectly. dont keep it on one spot for to long at a high speed or you will get a mark (like a hicky on your face) lol but it goes away within a couple of days.overall i am very pleased with this product :) thank you",0,1
114,114,5,I had been thinking for a while about how much I’ve neglected taking care of my skin since being a mom and how I wanted to do facials at least once a week like I used to. I don’t have sensitive skin but I do have oily skin in the Tzone area. My nose and under my lips area is where the white heads and oils grow and I usually sometimes squish the gunk out. This product came to my mind and I decided to purchase it. I was skeptical due to the reviews but there was more good than bad reviews so I decided to go with it. Purchased this item Monday and it arrived Tuesday and I just did my facial as I type (Wednesday) . It came charged so I didn’t have to charge it and it worked wonders. So much gunk came out of my tzone area and I felt really refreshed after. I used 3 out of the 4 suctions provided and I took my time. Use the suction at your own speed and adjust as necessary. I just did an 100$ facial at home with just a few simple products that I had already.,0,1

I recommend starting at the lowest setting and using it minimally because you can bruise yourself (like a faint hickie) pretty easily. I did it to my chin the first time I used it on 2 bars! So be careful! It’s great though, but make sure your face it moist or it pulls.",0,1
116,116,3,"I have a pretty oily face and lots of blackheads on my nose, so I was looking forward to this vacuum. While it did work exceptionally (see picture, ridiculous amounts of oil sucked out), and got out almost all my blackheads, it was quite painful even at low suction power settings. It was leaving painful red marks on my face for hours after use because it was just so strong. I still use it from time to time but I wish it was just less painful, maybe by rounding out the edges of the suction tip. Otherwise it’s a very effective product and will definitely keep your face clean.One thing to note, don’t use the gray massager tip (feels like a rough rock) because it’s actually been proven to cause micro tears in the skin, which could end up doing more damage than good. If you do insist on using it, use a light suction.",0,0
117,117,5,"I bought two of these as gifts for daughters--one a teen and the other college age. They chose this brand after watching several video and reading reviews of the various models available. They say the blackhead vacuum remover is helpful in removing dead skin, grease, makeup, and the blackheads too. The included tips with adjustable suction level are helpful. The device is convenient because it is rechargeable (lithium battery is good) with a visual LED display, and portable. It was also packaged in a box that can be used as storage too. They have only used the devices for a couple of months, so I cannot review the durability of the product at this time. However, it works as stated so far.",0,1

After a Qtip clean I was amazed at how much stuff was being sucked out of my skin. This product will make you ponder how clean your face really is.",0,1

Maybe it is coincidental thag I have started to notice my pores looking larger after I have used it, so I will refrain from assuming and accusing, maybe I am just more aware since I have started using this.

I've been using nose pore strips for awhile once per week, and while they clean most of my pores, there is always a bit left. That's why I decided to use this tool and I wasn't disappointed. I use the smallest round attachment and the speed 2-4, depending on how deep my pores are. Be careful not to stay on the same area for longer than ~3s since it can cause bruising - the suction is strong! I am very happy with the results when I use this tool first and then a nose strip for a final touch. I now do it every 10-14 days since there is a less need to do it compared to just nose strips.",0,1

It cleaned up the blackheads I’ve been trying to get rid of for quite some time, in the crease on my nose. Both sides are cleared up. It comes with 4 heads of different sizes, and shapes. It has a rechargeable battery and seems to be built very well! It was well worth the money, and wouldn’t hesitate buying another one in the future! This will definitely be a tool in our cabinet for quite some time! Needless to say, I’m VERY IMPRESSED with the product!",0,1

(ew) The battery charge that it came with was at about 75% of a charge and has lasted a month. I just charged it and it's just like a cell phone, shows the amount of juice left. It comes with multiple attachments but I use the same 2. There is an instruction book on how to use it. If I had to pick one thing I didn't like about it, it would only be that I have trouble sometimes with the intensity. I try to keep it as low as possible because I have sensitive skin. It's never left a ""hickey"" mark because I don't hold it longer than 3 seconds in one spot. I will use it on my nose twice, though. Overall, I recommend you check it out.",0,1
127,127,5,"This product is really awesome! I just got it, my first time using it today, it worked really well. I'm satisfied! I read some other reviews which were bad and I thought to myself... If it works on me it should work on other. I personally dont think other ppl followed directions. To avoid bruising you have to move it around. My first time use you pretty much figure out what setting works for you. Common sense tells me of course you're going to be red for a little while, which I don't mind... Means its working. My face looks clearer right after use and even the next day. I highly recommend for those with acne issues especially on the nose area..",0,1

I have been having issues with black heads and white heads although over all my skin is very clear I do have problem areas on the side of my face a little past my cheeks. Its hard to see the part of my face in the mirror but can always feel little bumps or when I take a picture up close I can see them a little better. But let me tell you after just one use of the black head remover you could see all the nasty grime coming out of my face. Be careful, because I did get a little carried away and ended up with a red face but it did go away the next day but it was definitely worth it! I can already see I bug difference from how the side of my face feels",0,1
129,129,3,"UPDATE: While this little device has done more to clear up my skin than any exfoliator, mask, or cleanser... The motor broke down ONE DAY after the 30 day return window smh. Huge bummer. I dont really have a problem with blackheads. I do (did) have oily and clogged pores though, and pretty sensitive skin. The first two days I used it I went super light and fast over my face with the larger of the suction heads. After no bruising or irritation occurred I decided to go ahead and break out the small circular head and take my time combing my problem areas. I. AM. SHOOK. I’ve never had “glowing” skin before, thought that was just a BS marketing term, but when I woke up the next morning “glowing” is the only word that fit how I looked. It’s incredible.

130,130,5,"I absolutely love my blackhead remover! My skin has improved significantly since I started using it! It’s very easy to use and does an excellent job at removing dead skin and whiteheads! It used to take me over an hour to do a facial; however, now I can do my facials in only a fraction of that time.There are 4 different detachable tips that serve different functions (massage and exfoliate, suction and skin tightening, cleaning pore, and smooth fine lines). And because the tips are detachable, it’s easy to clean them; I just pull them off and wash them with soap and water, or if I’m feeling lazy, I’ll run a cotton swab with alcohol over the tip.This device makes the facial process soooo much easier and even enjoyable! I actually look forward to using this thing lol the suction is fantastic! There are about 5 levels of suction which is really nice. I recommend starting on a lower level and then slowly increasing the suction from there because the highest level of suction is EXTREMELY strong. I also recommend using this device after a shower or bath because then it’s much easier to extract whiteheads once your skin has been softened.I also like that it collects all of the whiteheads and dead skin as you move it across your face; this makes it possible to extract whiteheads so much easier and faster! And last but not least, I have noticed significant improvements in my skin!! My face is so much clearer and my pores are much smaller.",0,1

It does do a good job overall. My nose was extremely red, but in the morning the redness went away. After just a couple of days using it every night I feel my nose feels smoother and it has helped my black heads. I believe this product is not an instant fix like you see in the ads; you have to repeatedly use it routinely in order to see any results.",0,1
132,132,5,"This little device surprised me! I saw a write up on it online and thought it might be helpful since I have very oily skin :-/I ordered it and it arrived in a handy magnetic/closure case that I can easily store away. See my photos of the unboxing. Do read the instructions in the box and other reviews on Amazon to get tips and best practices for this. The suction power is strong enough for me just on the first setting (there are 4 levels of suction). Perhaps I’ll get up to the other levels, but I’m happy with the results of the first level of suction.The device is easy to charge, to turn on, and to set the level of suction. Test it on your finger to get a sense of the suction before applying it to your face. As I used the device, the oil and blackheads that came out were truly ewwww. I had to use a couple of qtips to clean the gunk from the inside of the blue suction tip. I’m glad I did this treatment.I do recommend you use a hot washcloth on your face to relax the pores before treatment and then a cold washcloth after treatment to calm the skin.I’ll recommend this to my friends!",0,1

I was hesitant in buying at first due to some reviews saying that this product doesn’t work, however, the first day I got it in the mail I tried it and holy guacamole the amount of crap that came out of my face. You have to be careful because the suction is powerful. I would recommend leaving it in the lowest setting possible and you should be fine. If you don’t, your face will definitely have bruises so please be careful. Yes, your face will be red for like 24 hours but it is so worth it. When I woke up the next day, my face was so much brighter and smooth. I have a steamer that I used right before using this product to make sure my pores were nice and open and I had no issues removing lots of white heads and blackheads. This is definitely worth the buy. Highly recommend!!!",0,1

It is mention in manual but since I have sensitive skin i did it for 2 seconds and my skin got soft the next day, feels nice and clean too. The suction power is very amazing, it cleans your skin. It will remain the pores but i used tonner to close it the pores. Best time to use the blackead remover is after shower. I would definitely recommend for this product to buy next time.",0,1

After I was done and washed my face I waited an hour or two for my skin to calm and I could immediately see a difference from before.

This won't fix my red skin, but it cuts ALMOST ALL the oil from my face! That's more than I ever thought I'd get, honestly. I'm so skeptical of beauty products, I found success in DYI-ing most of my own.But using it for months had a HUGE impact on my face! I cut back using it to only twice a week! Hardly more than a fingernail came off my face since then. And it started as off as a LOT more. At least 4 cotton swabs worth. Gross.But it sucks out more than oil and blackheads. It sucks out dead or peeling skin! So if my face does get dry enough in winter to start peeling, it's totally gone! I can use foundation for my blotchy skin!Sadly, after my sucker broke on a flight, the oil returned to my face like 10 fold.

Also the recharge was fast and it's still has a full charge using it daily for over a week now.

148,148,5,"It works! But please remember there are manufacturer instructions for a reason... if you don’t follow, you may not get the results you hope for. It worked best on my chin and creases of my nose since there is more skin there. The bridge of my nose was difficult due to there not being enough skin for the suction cap to grab onto. Simple fix! Just push skin over from the other side with your free hand 😊 I would advise to heed the manual’s suggestions of placing a warm cloth for 5 minutes on skin before use and rinsing with cold water afterwards. The warm cloth allows the pores to open so there’s something to grab onto when you suction. The cold water closes those same pores so more bacteria doesn’t get in and it also stops any swelling that may be occurring. I would also suggest small strokes as opposed to leaving the device in the same place for too long to prevent bruising... but this is in the manual as well. Follow directions and your skin will be clear, smooth and tight!",0,1

Also it works great in getting rid of all the dead skin and oils on my nose and forehead.

The second time I showered and applied a hot rag to my face to open my pours. I was too nervous to try the highest setting even though I have oily skin. The second setting alone was enough to pull out crazy amounts of dirt from my pours. Follow the directions and use this with very open pours. I didn’t experience any swelling or redness. I dragged it across my face as instructions recommend and my blackheads are waaaaayyyyy less! I can’t wait to see how long term use helps my pours. I highly recommend this product.,0,1

Initially I was a bit hesitant in ordering this, but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try, and to my surprise it worked! The instructions are a bit choppy, but I understood the directions/warnings. It didn't come fully charged, so to ensure I got the best results, I made sure to fully charge it before I used it. I used the bigger size head(it comes with 3 different sizes, 4 total) which was already attached to the device. Make sure your face is clean or all you will suction is your makeup and oil. I wouldn't recommend doing two passes over the same area or you can bruise(I bruised on my chin a little from doing two passes) I also used a warm wash clothe to open up my pores before suctioning. I started on my chin(the directions said to start there) and continued doing it sections until I was finished. I changed the head size to the smaller circle pore size to do my nose. For people who have sensitive skin be extremely careful because the suction is VERY strong even on the lowest setting. I could see all the oil from my pores inside the head piece. YUCK! Overall this product is a great buy for less than $35!",0,1
154,154,5,"Let me start off by saying that I’ve used this twice, so far.The first time I used it, I used the small circular attachment because apart from having sensitive skin, I was scared it would hurt. I had just moisturized and decided to use it (I’d advice to wet your face with warm water before to open your pores). It says right there to not leave it on the same spot for too long and to not press it hard against your skin. At first, it is scary because the suction is so strong that it’s hard to maneuver it. I was so surprised that It pulled out SO. MANY. BLACKHEADS. Well, not that surprised because I did have a lot but I was surprised that this actually worked.The second time around, I wet a rag with hot water and placed it on my face, to open up my pores, and it pulled out even more blackheads. I used the large circular head because I was more comfortable with it and used it all over my face. This product mentions that it absorbs grease too and I’d have to agree on that. My skin isn’t as oily as it was before using this. I like that it has multiple attachment suctions. This has been incorporated into my skin care routine, thank you!",0,1
155,155,5,"It works great, the suction power is very strong, there are 4 interchangeable heads to change based on the area of the face need to clean, i personally like the way it easy to use, I have taken a shower using the soap to clean the face first, then using this device to clean and remove the blackhead, finally using the clean warm water to apply and soft wipe the face, did this for few days, the skin getting so soft and smooth the blackhead is gone. great product. i love it very much.Been using this product for about 2-3 days now. Skin looks noticeably clearer. Nose pores are not as dark/dirty. Suction can be harsh to skin so make sure you build up tolerance and use every other day. Does not clean as deeply as I would have hoped for but still an improvement to skin.",0,1
156,156,5,"I can't believe how well this worked! I typically would use Biore pore strips, but this is way faster and tbh, more fun. Washed my face with warm water, patted it dry with a towel, and then gave this a go. I used the large circle head and ran it over my problem areas, letting it sit for 2-4 seconds at a time. The most satisfying part of using a strip is seeing all the residue that came out of your nose at the end, right? The novelty is not lost here--just wipe around the head with a q tip and you'll see way worse once your done. Gross, but super satisfying. Considering that the pore strips are about $10 a box at Target, this gadget is definitely more cost effective in the long run. Was apprehensive about it at first, but really glad I bought it!",0,1
157,157,5,"I was going back and forth on whether or not I should buy a product like this since I struggle a lot with blackheads. I finally gave in and purchased this one based on the reviews. The four attachments that it comes with makes it easy to use on different places of your face. I mainly use the small circle one and the exfoliator and it leaves my skin so soft and my pores so clean. There's 5 different suction levels and since my skin isn't super sensitive I usually use levels 3-5 because that works best for me, but you'll have to test it out a bit when you first get it to see how it works with your skin. It surprised me a lot with how much it's able to pull out though, AFTER I cleanse my face after a normal day and all that.",0,1
158,158,1,I have been using this blackhead remover for a few months now and am completely satisfied with this product. It is easy to use and adjustable head sizes as well as suction levels. I got myself a face steamer to use beforehand to make the suction process easier and smoother. I absolutely recommend this product for removing black heads.,0,0
159,159,4,"So I have an actual purchase, actual user review. I really like it. Better than I thought I would. I was a little nervous at first because I didn't want to hurt my skin. But I've used so many of those nose strips and I finally figured it was about the same thing. Holy cow, it really does work. It's not the strongest suction I thought it would be, but that might be better because to me it seems like it's less likely to damage my skin that way. So far I've used it on my nose. I use this and then wash with phisoderm and then finish with witch hazel. Done that for 4 days now and I think it does help.",0,1
160,160,5,"I am addicted to any and everything that has to deal with having clean skin. This little thing is powerful and comes with extra tips to suction around your face and it really does a great job. I also like the fact that those pieces are detachable and easy to clean so you can have your friends try it out too. In this case, it was my sister and her kid that tried it. You can't imagine how powerful it is and it doesn't seem like much on your fingertip but it is a lot for your face. Start on a lower setting and then make your way up if you need to.",0,1
161,161,5,"I originally purchased one of these items for myself and could not believe how good they work. I will say it is a little gross our skin is so dirty you can not imagine until you have used one of these.My daughter is home from college and I got this for her she loves it it is almost addicting, her face is clean, she says it is so cool my face is red when done but the junk that comes out om my poors is stifling. This little uint is powerful easy to clean and is just a great buy for yourself or as a gift go get one and clean up.....",0,1
162,162,1,"I opened and used this gadget as soon as it was delivered to me. It has straight to the point instructions and tips. I felt that it worked great on my nose. I couldn't believe what came out of my nose alone (I'll spare the gross but satisfying picture). I also love the fact the heads are replaceable and very easy to clean.Update: After using a few times, nothing seems to come out of my skin, even though I can see the blackheads. Will be trying some other method to get the stubborn areas!",0,0
163,163,4,"This vacuum remover is the easiest and most painless way to rid your face of blackheads. After steaming, the vacuum scoops the blackheads right out. Its a little uncomfortable at first but definitely better than squeezing them out! The original nose was very rough to the touch.After use, the nose acne is gone.The acne remains on the probe.The effect is very good and i Highly recommended",0,1
164,164,5,"I have been wanting one of these for a while but was a little weary of it. I’m glad I finally tried it out because I am impressed with how much I got out of my skin; so much more than I ever would with manual extractions. I never knew there was so much gross stuff in there! When I first used it, I kept it on a low setting and kept it moving, no more than a second on each area. I did end up with a couple small bruises my first time, but they were easily covered by concealer and makeup. I would recommend trying it out when you don’t have to go anywhere important for a couple days, just in case. It definitely helps to use right out of a hot shower, or after a hot towel to open your pores.",0,1
165,165,5,"Updated: I have had this product for about six months. I have not had any problems with this product. The quality is wonderful and even better at an affordable price. I still am glad I purchased this product and would again if needed.Original post:I purchased this for my teenage son and myself and have been using this for about a week. For my son, it has not completely cleared his face but it has helped tremendously reduce the number and size of his acne. I believe the rest is just part of his age. My face, however, is brighter, I feel I look more youthful and my face is so soft. I have adult acne and this helped with mine as well. I still get them but again they are smaller and they never really get to where you have to pop them. I am so glad I purchased this product!",0,1
166,166,3,"I first tried this out on my dry skin, which did absolutely nothing except make my skin a little red, but I later tried it right after a warm shower, and it helped me with my blackhead problem. It helped me, but didn't do all the work. It also only worked on my nose and no where else unlike other people who say it helps with acne. It doesn't hurt though which is good. I guess it just depends on the person like how bad your blackheads/acne is and how oily your skin is. The bigger your pores the more it will help. I hope this helps. 🙂",0,0
167,167,1,Does NOT Work. This product does have suction however it does not suck out blackheads as it is labeled to do. Even on adult skin and even on my twelve-year-old daughter skin. This product is worthless and useless.,0,0
168,168,5,"I love this device. I have terrible amount of blackheads on my nose (some of them the diameter of a toothpick). I tried lotions, strips, and a lot of scrubbing; but I was unhappy with the results. I used this for 10 minutes and I can clearly see all the dirt that came out of my pores.Combined with a steamer to open the pores, this sucks everything right out. It functions like a small stanley steamer carpet cleaner.The only downside: I wouldn't recommend trying this before going to a social event. I used this around my nose, my cheeks and between my eyebrows. Each side of my nose and in between my eyebrows were blood red my first time. Fortunately, I wasn't busy that weekend; and my skin went back to normal within 36 hours. That said, I would still recommend this.",0,1
169,169,5,"Buy it. It works!! I wish I had known about this little tool years ago, because I’ve spent a good amount of money on pore strips. This picture is the dirt and oil that it sucked out of the pores only on the right side of my nose. 😳 // It’s easy to use. Just make sure it’s fully charged, screw on the tip you want to use, press the power button and then turn the suction up or down depending on your preference. I had mine set on level 2, and it worked great. I feel like if I had it set any higher, I might end up with hickey dots all over my face 😄 Move it continuously around your trouble areas. It has really powerful suction, and if you let it sit too long in one area, it will leave a red mark. // HIGHLY RECOMMEND! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",0,1
170,170,4,"I’ve used it once so far but I’m writing this review to warn others. I’ve been looking into buying a lore vacuum to clean out the pores on my nose and Im so glad I went with this one. After I was done I could notice a huge difference in my nose pores, especially when I put makeup on. The suction is GREAT!! I have to use it at level 2 because that’s how strong it is, so you know it’s pulling a lot of gunk out. The only thing I would say is Im still learning to use it properly because if you don’t know how or you leave it on one certain area for three seconds you will end up with face hickies which is what happened to me lol. Besides that I would definitely recommend this product just work with it slowly and don’t use it for too long in one area keep it moving the whole time.",0,1
171,171,1,"I would actually write a review if I could... except when I opened my package and took out the box, it felt really light. I opened it up and wow, NOTHING WAS IN THE BOX. Except a tip.",0,0
172,172,5,This thing sucks out EVERYTHING! And it’s SO easy to use. I didn’t need to read the directions but they’re easy to read and follow if you’d like to. My skin is looking clearer and better after the first use. I’ve used twice now and am in love. I buy all sorts of beauty stuff and mostly they never do what’s advertised and it all ends up in a drawer. This thing is totally different. Love it and it’s gonna get used all the time and does everything it says it does and more. Yes-the suction is strong so don’t leave it in one spot too long lol but that’s so easy to do.,0,1
173,173,4,"I've tried this product twice and both times it left suction bruises and lines for over 24 hours. As recommended in the directions and other reviews, I didn't let it stay on any portion of my skin for more than 2 seconds and only used the lowest suction and the widest adapter. While the bruises and suction circles still remain, it barely vacuumed up any of the junk in my pores, though I had a hot towel and steam right beforehand. There was little in the suction adapter. I don't recommend this item to anyone with remotely sensitive skin; you'll have to avoid people or wear a ton of foundation to cover up the mess it will make of your face in the process of trying to remove the blemishes.",0,1
174,174,5,"After doing a lot of research on which pore vacuum I should buy, I finally pulled the trigger on this one. It hasn't disappointed! The suction power is very impressive. You have to be careful to not hold it on one spot, or drag it too slow on a focused area because it WILL create a bruising/hickey affect. Other than that, I love this product! I find that it works best after I take a hot shower or hold a hot cloth over my face for a while to help open my pores. I wouldn't recommend using it every day, but every couple of days rather. There's a learning curve for this product but I really do like it! I waited a few months to review so I could review honestly!",0,1
175,175,5,This works! I am not going to post pictures of what was extracted but my 17 year old and I (mom) both use it for blackhead extracting and it does work. The instructions are a little unclear in the sense they don’t explain the levels of power or how to clean it or the sponge (but say don’t get it wet). The questions and comments were helpful.,0,1
176,176,5,"This is the first time I’ve used this product and surprisingly I liked it. The packaging came in exactly as shown. It was a box with all the accessories and the unit itself. There are different modes of suction and different nozzles to fit different parts of your face. It’s rechargeable too so it came with a a cord which I liked. Hate doing batteries so this was good! The suction on the highest setting is really strong too so just be careful..if you have sensitive skin, try the lowest setting going up",0,1
177,177,5,"I’ve never had a problem with acne but my pores! Can you say craters on the moon? So of course I’ve had terrible blackheads. Operative word is HAD. This device is seriously amazing for whisking away all that gunk hanging out in your pores. Definitely open up your pores with a warm washcloth beforehand and very important, you must move the unit quickly over your face. Use the low setting until you get the hang of it. The device is ready to go out of the package but I recommend charging it first. Instructions are super easy to follow and there are four different attachments.",0,1
178,178,5,"I gave it a 5 for sensitive skin because it has different power levels that accommodate all types of skin. I was surprised at how mush oily gunk came on to the tube. Most of the gunk came from my nose. I’m not sure if the recommended use if daily or weekly. But I do a deep cleansing on the weekends so I plan to just add it to my weekly routine. Great buy.UPDATE: after several use, I noticed that it makes my pores larger after use. But it still does get a significant amount of oily gunk out.",0,1
179,179,5,"Honestly, I was shocked to see what came out of my pores! :-O And now I am kind of obsessed with this thing. Few tips: do not be like me and start using it right out of the package (I was too curious) - make sure your pores are opened up! Take a hot shower, put warm towel on your face, or something else - otherwise you might end up with tiny hickies all over LOL. Also do NOT hold it in one place for too long or... yup tiny hickie will happen!My skin feels soooooo velvety after using it. I think it will be my to-go gift this year :)",0,1
180,180,5,Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He has larger pores on his nose and he is always using nose strips. Mind you he works outside year round too so that doesn’t help his skin either. This definitely helped clear out the gunk from his pores and was easy to use. The only thing is that it is very strong and can be harsh on the skin and thus drying. I’d recommend having a nice moisturizer too use with these and maybe only using a handful of times a week. Great little tool to have in your skin care regiment.,0,1
181,181,4,"I love this product. I miiiiiiight be spending less in facials now. We shall see. All I know is I felt so clean after using it! It has definitely been a great addition. The suction is strong so just don't leave it on one spot for too long which you probably have heard ten billion times.I just hope that what I read a few days after using it for the first time isn't true; apparently, it is really bad for your skin, creating permanent dark and/or red spots due to broken capillaries. Then again, that was from a random source via the internet. It probably depends on whether or not the item is being used properly. I will be checking with a trusted professional soon.",0,1
182,182,4,This is a nice unit and works as it is supposed to. Do not expect to look like the after picture after one use. It's an ongoing process that takes awhile which would be true for any brand you buy. The same unit is sold by As Seen on TV in different packaging for 10 dollars less. I didn't give the unit a five because I object to the enclosed card that gives a 10 dollar rebate to anyone giving a 5 star review. The unit and tips are excellent quality and it comes charged and ready to use.,0,1
183,183,1,concept is cool except that it does not work for blackheads. all it does is suck the grease from your skin surface. don't waste time and money. I am returning it.,0,0

185,185,4,"I have used it several times and have noticed a great improvement. I like the way comes with several different sized heads, You can also choose what level of suction you want, Was pleasantly surprised, has different levels of suction from weak to pretty strong, easy to use. Just make sure to open your pores up a little beforehand to make it easier to remove washing with hot water or letting a hot wet towel rest over your face for a couple minutes is the best idea. Over all not bad",0,1
186,186,3,"Not what I expected from reading the reviews? I used this on myself first, I have blackheads on my chin, cheeks, and nose. I’ve had it since middle school. I tried it with my boyfriend and nothing was happening. We changed the tools multiple times but nothing. Then we tried it on his nose. Again, nothing. All it did was scratch his nose and we had to force it harder but nothing.",0,0
187,187,4,"This product makes my face feel cleaner and less oily after use! It has amazing suction so I've never even had to use above the 2nd level. It holds its' charge for really long too which is nice. I haven't really gotten any 'gunk' out of my pores... it has mainly been oil and whiteheads, but I can't say that that is the products fault (I may just not have as clogged of pores as I thought). Nonetheless, it has cleared my face up and the amount of oil that it extracts is crazy (especially since I use it immediately after showering and cleaning my face)! All in all, I would recommend this product!!",0,1
188,188,5,Ive used alot of facial treatments 4 my face and this is by far the best one I've used in so happy. Satisfied. Not 2 mention my daughter who is teenager can put it 2 ise as well.Suction power is wonderful as if 2 say I can feel it working immediately.Im in love and will tell everyone I know 2 snag one . worth every penny . thanks,0,1
189,189,1,I’m surprised by all the great reviews of this product. It did absolutely nothing for me. The suction is powerful but it did not actually suck any blackheads out. I wouldn’t recommend using a suction level over 3 because it will probably bruise you.,0,0
190,190,4,"The product comes with many different size adapters and doesn't require batteries it USB powered. The led to display the battery status, which is a nice feature. The suction on this product is not the best; it kinds weak, in my opinion. The device itself is straightforward to use and easy to hold while using. The unit is power with a USB cord, which does not come with USB charger brick. It would nice if the product came with a carrying case or some type of storage container.",0,1
191,191,5,This has absolutely changed my life! Used it every few days at first and my face completely cleared up. Now I just use it when I start to get a minor break out. I have combination skin and I just recommend keeping your face wet with warm water to keep your pores open. Don’t hold it in one spot more than a second because it’ll give you a little hicky. I finish with sanitizing the tools and washing my face to get rid of any bacteria that was exposed and applying vitamin C serum to my face and of course light moisturizer,0,1
192,192,5,"Used it right out of the box! It works even when plugged in and charging which is a fabulous plus and how I tried it out! Works great, tried all the suction levels in my problem area (around my nose) and took EVERYTHING out including built up blackheads under the skin. I wash my face all the time, exfoliate etc and wanted something inexpensive to help boost my facial regiment. This works wonders and for the price it doesn’t exactly what I want it to do. Comes with multiple heads for different things- I bought this for stubborn black heads etc nothing more. It took a ton of crud out on the first try. My face isn’t red or hurting from it but definitely had to put on facial lotions after because my skin had been deeply cleaned and needed a bit of moisture added back in. Great product and does exactly what I want it to do.Note for many people- you CAN turn down the suction as it’s attached to your face if it is too intense. You don’t have to just “suck it up” lol and deal with it.",0,1
193,193,5,"This thing is so fun to play with! I'm a goofball so of course I HAD to stick it on my lip😂, BUT for purposes of a productive review- it has both low and high suction and everything in between(with easy adjusting), the different heads are super easy to interchange and the exfoliating one is just as good as getting a microdermabrasion treatment at a spa! My skin is baby smooth! I recommend following up with your favorite serum because that's when your skin will absorb it right up(and get maximum absorption of your favorite ingredients)! A little pinkies is perfectly normal(because you're taking off dead skin) but should subside within a few mins to a couple hours or a day depending on your skin sensitivity and how hard you suctioned. But this thing is PHENOMENAL!",0,1
194,194,1,"I wish I have use it before the return window is still open! basically I bought it almost a year ago and put it in a drawer, now couple days ago, i used it and no suction at all, I thought it is the battery, I put it in charge, while presumably it was charging, it was beeping, I tried to use it while in charge and is not working! I was so disappointed, especially that I could not return it, basically I payed $21 for a piece of junk! So, decided to write this review so this not happen to you!",0,0
195,195,5,This is amazing. I used it on myself and saw a good improvement in my face. I did over do it and ended up with bruises. You have to get used to adjusting the settings and finding what works for you. It's a perfect after shower tool. I used it on my boyfriend and I was BLOWN AWAY! Believe the pictures you see! No more squeezing and hurting. Perfect tool!! Very happy. We ended up using it on his face two nights in a row and it got out so much gunk that I could get out just by squeezing.,0,1
196,196,5,"Let me just state that I am writing this review on my Husband’s account because I don’t have my own....Anyway, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well this works! The first time I tried using it, I hardly got anything out and was super disappointed. I followed all the directions and even steamed my face with a facial steamer prior to using it and nothing came out! I decided to try it again because my skin was dry after using my steamer and maybe my pores closed up. So the second time I used it, I decided to steam my face for a few minutes and then while the steamer was continuing, I would use this device. WOW!! I couldn’t believe how much it pulled out (pictures for proof)! I used it on the second setting as well and any redness that it caused, it went away fairly quickly! I haven’t used the other sizes, but the smallest size was fairly impressive!",0,1
197,197,3,"Pros:I really like the fact that you can choose the amount of suction. I haven’t had it long enough to see major benefits, but I know it really got a lot out of the pores of my nose from the very first use. Once you begin to get the hang of it, it gets a lot easier to use.Con:One con would be clearly knowing which head goes for what, or how long to use the suction or in what direction is best. I am just sort of figuring it out as I got.TARGET AUDIENCEThis is for anyone with a face, lol. Lines, blackheads, whiteheads, acne, etc.CONCLUSIONFor the amount of money I paid, I am pretty happy with the product. I am looking forward to seeing good results with this the more I use it.",0,0
198,198,5,"My wife and I had been wanting to try one of these for a while now because of the small blackheads we tend to get on the bridge of the nose. Before receiving this product I was a bit skeptical as to whether or not it would irritate my skin or cause redness on my face, but to my pleasant surprise, I have had no issues and no regrets with this purchase. It is easy to use and easy to wash when you need to. I recommend this to anyone who has not tried a suction method in trying to clear out blackheads.",0,1
199,199,4,"I have had this for about a month now so I feel that it has been enough time to provide a helpful review. I love everything about this product except for the volume of the beeping when you’re adjusting settings. It’s unnecessarily loud lol but besides that the device is amazing, it is both satisfying and disgusting that the suction power is so strong. My skin consistently overproduced sebum, so this product has been a lifesaver. I use it about 1-2 times per week. Be extra conscious of moving the device around while the suction is on your face, otherwise if you leave it in one spot you will bruise.",0,1
200,200,5,"My friend recommended me to buy a blackhead remover vacuum. I was hesitated when I decided to buy this one. However, I had very good impression after the first time using it. I used it immediately on the first day I got it and it works better than I expected. I have oil skin so I use it twice a week (not more than 2-follow the instruction). I have a lot of blackheads and whiteheads on my nose and this device has removed much from my pores. It’s also reduce oil on my T-zone. I read some tips from “customer question and answer” and follow these instruction. After the first week, I realize that my facial skin has great improvement.",0,1
201,201,5,"So I really am enjoying integrating this tool into my skincare routine. I’ve always had bigger pores & suffered from chronic blackheads. I’ve tried the Biore strip removal with no success, so I pretty much gave up and just left them there.After finally splurging on this purchase, I’m so glad I did. My only advice would be that you need to move the device SLOWWWWLY for it to work. I was going much too quickly at first, and it wasn’t picking anything up. Once I moved at a much slower pace, I was able to visibly see a ton of junk caught in the tip (picture attached).It’s awesome - best used before bed, as it does make your skin a little red. I use the tool, apply moisturizer, and by the morning it’s bright and clear. Totally worth the price!",0,1

203,203,5,This product gave me a lot for my buck! After seeing so many reviews of this product I had to try it and was no disappointed at all. It comes with four adjustable suction heads and you can adjust the suction power. When I first opened the product it was already charged which I really liked because I could try it as soon as it arrived. I wouldn’t recommend using this product before going out because it does pull on the skin leaving red marks but besides that so happy with this !,0,1
204,204,5,"I use this product every two weeks. It has made my skin not only clearer but because of this my makeup goes on more smoothly and looks so much better as well. The suction also increases blood flow which is wonderful. Makes your skin soft and clear. BUT you must use it correctly. Open your pores before use with steam from boiling water or take a hot shower OR the best is to use it after you work out or do housework that is physical. Then you have to use it in the right direction. On your nose, cheeks, and chin use it up to down and on your forehead use it down up. This is what has worked best for me. If you have sensitive skin like I do it works just fine and if your skin gets red or irritated (normal because it is increasing blood flow) then ice your skin after use. DEFINITELY would recommend because I would buy it again if I broke it/lost it/or it wore out its lifespan.",0,1
205,205,1,All this thing did was bring the dirt and grease to the top of my pores. If you put the suction all the way up you get hickeys all over your face.,0,0

207,207,3,"I purchased this based on the reviews of being good at getting out blackheads, but I don’t feel like it worked for me. I usually do face masks or the nose strips, but wanted to try something quicker for when I don’t have as much time- particularly just for my nose. I even tried after steaming with a rag and a long shower and the highest setting didn’t seem to pull everything out, just enough for me to pull the rest with tweezers which is counter productive. I also couldn’t return it which was frustrating because it came from China I think.",0,0
208,208,5,"I have really enjoyed this! I was shocked at how much it got out of my pores on my nose. I also struggle with the skin on my nose peeling when it gets dry. This has helped with getting that dead skin off as well! I love it!I do want to mention that my husband has used this several times and he gets little bruises on his nose that last a day or two. It doesn't hurt him, but you definitely notice. I don't have any issues with this, but I wanted to mention that!",0,1
209,209,5,I had been wanting one of these for a while now. This one was a great price and works well. I always get something out when I use it. I’ve started using it about once a week. Love the color (pink is my favorite.) I can tell a difference on my nose for sure (that is where my problem blackheads are).,0,1
210,210,5,"My fiancé bothers me to take out his blackheads from his nose with a blackhead extractor tool and it is time consuming. My fiancé brings it up most of the time that he wants to try the blackhead remover vacuum. And, so I decided to buy him this product based on the good reviews. I'm so glad that I purchased this product. It actually works! I tried it on my fiancé's nose right when my order arrived. Just make sure not to stay on the same place of the skin for too long or you'll end up giving yourself a hickey. I love how there are different kinds of suction probes. I am really happy with this product!",0,1
211,211,5,"I love this blackhead vacuum... It was so simple and easy to use. There are different attachments to take care of all sorts of different needs.The price was great and the product works perfect for me. My skin feels better after using it. At first it felt a little pain, but now I feel good every time I use it.I recommend if you want a better skin face.",0,1
212,212,2,"I’ll give this two stars for effort. It does have good suction but did not pull any blackheads out. I could see it trying to, though.. just not enough power for my son’s blackheads. We tried it before and after showering with no difference. I’ll be sending it back.",0,0
213,213,5,We read the directions and gave it a try. It was so cool and gross lol. Sliding it across the skin seems to help get the blackheads to pop out easier. My husband loves it. I love that it came with different heads. We used the different heads. One head worked better for me and a different one worked better for my husband.,0,1
214,214,5,"I've been using this product about 2 weeks now. I use it every few days to clean out the pores on and around my nose, and right below my lower lip. I use the oval head to plump and pull out the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. After, my skin looks cleaner and healthier. I don't think I""m getting as many breakouts. The fine lines are starting to fill, a little at a time. I really like this product. Its easy, fast, and I love that its rechargeable.",0,1
215,215,1,"Not sure what everyone else is talking about, it sucks pretty well, but hasn’t cleaned my white/black heads. Wife and I both tried with the same results.

218,218,5,"I used this product on my face (specifically my t-zone). I immediately saw this thing sucking the grime out of my pores. I did learn that I do have to keep it moving. I bruised my nose a bit the first use (totally my fault), but I just put ice on it for a minute and it . was gone the next day. Lesson learned. Also, the first time I did it on dry skin. Still worked, but the second use, I steamed my face for a minute and then used it. There was less irritation that way and it still worked like a charm! I have dry, sensitive skin and other than the little bruise, again, MY fault, I recommend this product! 3 of the ladies at my office are ordering after I told them about it!",0,1
219,219,5,"I am quite impressed with this little tool. While I don’t have prominent black heads that I wanted to remove, I definitely struggle with getting my skin as clean as I would like. I could see oil, dirt, makeup in my pores, especially on my nose, and had little success with pore cleaning strips. Enter this bad boy! I can’t believe how much suction it has. I laughed when I turned it on because it made a tiny, unimpressive sound so I cranked it up, but the second it found suction on my nose I had to scramble to turn it down. Definitely read the directions throughly before using! They were clear and helpful and when I tried again I was impressed by the amount of “gunk” it removed. Now I look forward to using it each week to take my skin care routine one step further.",0,1

I did and it gave me a few red spots. they did go away about 24 hours later. start on the lower suction level and work up as needed. I got a lot of gunk out of my pores. I would buy it again and refer my friends to buy it as well. Happy with this purchase.",0,1
222,222,5,"Whoa, first off this thing is amazing! I didn't take a picture of what came out after the first use but it was definitely gross. So it works amazing.! Used it after the shower so my pores were more open and boy did that help!!! Definitely recommend!",0,1
223,223,5,"The suction power on this little thing is unreal! It worked so well and cleared my pores out quickly. Little note of caution though, dont leave it in one spot for too long, leaves little bruises. That being said, I will be using this often and I'd absolutely buy it again!",0,1
224,224,5,"I was skeptical, but after reading lots of reviews and seeing some images of how it worked for others, I decided to give this a try. OH, MY!! I was soooo impressed with this! I've only used it once, but it was the BEST experience ever! It cleansed my skin so well. I was a little swollen after cleansing, but nothing too bad and so worth it! I can NEVER be without this product again in my life. Totally recommend this. You won't regret buying it! Thank you for such an AMAZING product!",0,1

I had read so many great reviews on this product and seen so many commercials and videos featuring this ‘face vacuum’ and I was so intrigued I had to get one! I tried it right away and after steaming my face, sucking out my years of face dirt, and then washing off any residue left on the surface of my skin; my face is BABY SMOOTH! I can feel the difference and i would definitely recommend this to any one i know.Also, the suction has different levels so if you’re uneasy, thinking that the suction will be too much for your face; the suction is adjustable to suit your skin!",0,1
228,228,5,"This device works great! It's ready to use right out of the package, and even at the lower settings, the suction is quite strong (but works perfectly for people with sensitive skin- like me). So much so, in fact, that you have to be sure to move it around your face quickly, or you will get suction bruises. Saying this, even after a couple of uses, my face feels SO much smoother, and I would 100% recommend this to anyone who has ever had trouble with blackheads!UPDATE: I've now had this vacuum for a few months, and I have to say it has become a significant part of my beauty routine! My blackheads have noticeably diminished over time, so much so that a few family members have purchased this themselves. Practice makes perfect as far as using it goes, so I urge you to try it for a few days before rushing to conclusions. I quickly learned that starting at a low setting and working your way up to higher settings is the best way to determine what works for your skin, and moving it across your face at an even pace will keep it from bruising.",0,1
229,229,5,"Yea this thing works lol the suction is very very powerful. Just make sure you do this the night before your occasion because you may end up looking like you got into a bar fight. It actually got stuck under my eye for a moment and gave me a hickey 😂 takes some practice to get used to. It’s also painful. Like during the entire use. Which is to be expected but it hurt more than I thought. But to use it once a month or so to clear up some black heads, worth it.",0,1

I have never been able to fully clean out those pores with scrubs, masks, etc. There was always some left no matter what I did. This has helped me greatly. It comes with 4 different attachments and the one I like the most is the exfoliate one, with a little ""microcrystalline"" tip to it. I used it right after the shower and it sucked up all the dirt, oil, and blackheads on my nose. It has 5 suction modes, I've only used the first two because this thing is strong and if your not careful you'll give yourself hickeys all over your face lol... i recommend starting with the first level of suction and working up if you need to but definitely dont let it sit in one spot for too long. All in all it's the only thing that ever deeply cleaned my pores so I highly reccomend it, works wonders.",0,1

It took a few minutes to get the hang of but it really works. I like the oval attachment best because I think it is better shaped to get the side of my nose. I've used it twice (about once a week) and both times it really got some gunk up. Not sure if it removed any blackheads but it definitely sucked up some sebum/oil. My nose looks cleaner and it wasn't very irritating either and I have VERY sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend this product. It doesn't take much time to use and once you get the hang of it, it's super easy and quick.",0,1

235,235,5,Great product!! I’ve had one of these before that I got super cheap but it was just that - cheap. It broke after my first use. This product on the other hand I very sturdy and doesn’t feel like it will break easily. Super easy to use and does its job. My pores are so much cleaner!! Love it!! Only negative is that when you turn it on and change the suction level the beep is really loud. Not a fan of that but that’s the only negative!,0,1
236,236,5,"Okay so I bought this and I was expecting the worst. To my dismay I was totally wrong! It was already charged and ready to go. I should say that before I did this I placed a hot towel on my face for about 5 minutes. Anyway, I don’t know how anyone could use this on any setting other then the first because the suction is very strong! Not unbearable but perfect!! I did my nose and chin and the junk that came out was SO gross! I didn’t use on my entire face because I don’t see the point in it other then my problem areas. Anyway... I love this product and want to purchase one for my son as well. Or maybe for anyone I know lol. If you are on the fence about this like I was just DO IT!! My skin is also so soft after use. Absolutely loooooove this product!",0,1
237,237,4,"This pore vacuum was really easy to use. You basically charge it, choose a head and turn it to a comfortable suction setting. I liked the digital display. It also feels balanced and well made. My husband has really big pores on his face so it worked really well for him. I have small pores and it still got a ton out. Disgusting and so satisfying. My only complaint was the instruction manual. The English wasn't great. You could still figure it out but it was comical to read some parts out loud.",0,1
238,238,5,A friend recommended me a product similar to this and when I saw this I thought I would try it out. I read the instructions they were pretty easy to understand and the I like the variety of suction cups you can use for a variety of things for your face. It’s very easy to use and the different speeds helps control Certain areas on your face. I also think the price is reasonable so I do recommend this product to my friends and family.,0,1
239,239,4,"Very easy to use, just press the power button and start suctioning away. Instruction manual is helpful to tell you what each suction head is for. It’s advised to use level 4 for oily skin which is my skin type but when I tested it on level 2, it already left some bruising on my cheek. I’m going to let my skin get used to it before going to that high of a level.Overall, this device does work in removing my whiteheads. It doesn’t remove them all but I have a lot so I’ll be patient. I’m excited to see results after a few more weeks of using this. I also like that it came with blackness removing tools along with the device.",0,1
240,240,4,"I am still getting used the this product. I accidentally gave myself a face ""bruise"" on my eyebrow as I was learning how to use it. Works great on the T-Zone. Especially the nose. Wish there were better instructions and it was a little easier to understand. Had to watch some YouTube vids to understand how to use this properly. Will continue to use as it does get rid of some of the congestion on my nose.",0,1
241,241,4,I use this on my face only once a week to deep clean my pores. I like that it has different attachments and that you can regulate the suction strength. It is very powerful so use the lowest strength and don’t use it on the same place for too long.,0,1
242,242,5,"I had never used one of these before so I was surprised at just how strong the suction was! The good thing is, it had different levels of suction, so you can start low and work your way up. It is super easy to use and a really neat tool! Not at all hard to Understand. Tips: don’t leave it on one spot for too long or you will get a “hickey” mark. Moving it around is what helps it pull out impurities. Also, plan to do this before washing your face so that you can wash away what gets pulled out of your skin.",0,1
243,243,5,"Sadly I have oily skin with a fair amount of issues. I was looking for a less aggressive way of dealing with blemishes and I think I have found it.

Coupled with a good cleanser, I have noticed some developing improvements and would suggest this if you are at your wits end of getting your skin healthy.",0,1

I usually use a nose strip and it doesn’t always do the job, I’m thinking by using this blackhead remover along with the strip, I’ll never have blackheads again! I used level 4 suction and it didn’t leave marks on my nose at all. There’s other functions also like a face massager so I’m excited to try them out also.",0,1
245,245,1,"While this has extreme suction power, I saw nothing actually remove from my face. Its a little painful as well but thankfully it left no markings on my face after use. I was disappointed when my skin started breaking out after use instead of helping to eliminate blemishes... would not recommend.",0,0
246,246,5,"This product surprised me. I thought it was one of those gimmicks but it actually does work. Follow the instructions for sure on where you start on your face and which direction you go or otherwise it will leave you with red marks on your face. I have been using for several days. I mostly get blackheads and clogged pores around my nose and this has finally cleared it up for me! It absorbs blackheads and oil. After using, large pores have become small and each pore is clean! Good purchase!",0,1

Good for a deep clean but doesn't remove blackheads by itself 4. Pair device with a good facial routine, cleansing products and oil free moisturizer to get better results 5.

This has helped me avoid some nasty sores caused by blackheads.",0,1

After I charged it up, I thought I turned it up to full suction and took it to my chin. Nothing happened. I was so disappointed. I waited a couple hours then tried again and this time the suction was out of control strong! Initially I hadn't turned it up all the way like I thought I had. The key with the blackhead removal has been to move the suction down slowly and not holding it still over the same spot. I've also found that if it doesn't fully remove the blackhead, it will at least ""loosen it up"" so that it's easier for you to extract on your own. I haven't tried the other attachments yet as I primarily got this for blackhead removal. My only regret is that I hadn't gotten this a long time ago!",0,1
250,250,4,"I really liked this product for areas like my chin that have a concentrated area of small clogged pores. It brought them to the surface for removal. Didn’t work so well for larger pores.

The instructions were extremely easy to follow, the packaging is great, love that it’s chargeable, and best of all, it works! Absolutely suctioned our white heads, cleaned my pores, and left my skin feeling refreshed. I do have sensitive skin so much face turned quite red after using it. I applied serum and moisturizer and when I woke up the next day, wow! My skin looked so rejuvenated! I will say if you are new to this, less is more. Start very simple and not every day. Try two days a week and definitely follow the instructions!All-in-all, a GREAT and affordable purchase!! Will definitely recommend to others!",0,1

Seeing as I’m a chronic picker of my skin as well, the two go hand in hand (gross I know) . But this magical device helps eliminate the issue before it gets aggressive enough for my finger tips to locate them and fondle them into infection. Good suction, multiple settings with a noticeable difference in power. Different tips for different types of skin sensitively. Dialing in the tips for your skin type as well as the speed you move the vacuum across your face are key. To slow and you irritate the skin and leave marks, to fast and you just end up smearing the removed plague across your skin.

You gotta be cateful not to set it at full power at first, I recommend going up gradually. I didnt use it on all my face, only my nose because there is where I struggle with blackheads the most. I was shocked to see how much dirt and grease this bad boy can suck! I like the design and the fact that is in increibly easy to use, no brainer. I definitely recommend this product 100%.",0,1

I don’t play like that sooooo here’s my honest review-Make sure your pores are open before using this. The exfoliator tip does a good job of getting dead skin off your nose but it leaves it kinda looking like a peeling sunburn. Watch your levels of suction on different parts of your face because it will bruise your face.My husband has big pores so it did get a nice amount of gunk from his nose but my pores are small (tons of blackheads though) and it didn’t do much. If I just took a steamy shower it will work a tad better but I need to use the exfolitor tip, get dead skin off, then use the suction and I think it would work best.Overall I like it...not the BEST thing in the world but it’s fun to use.",1,0
259,259,5,"I was so excited to use this but was hesitant because other reviews of different products similar to this I had read, said they didn’t work. However, this one does. I was delighted and disgusted to see how much oil, dead skin, and sebum the vacuum had pulled from my skin. I suggest starting at the lower settings of suction and working your way up once your more comfortable with moving it along your face. Simply follow the instructions and you won’t have any “hickeys” or bruising. Don’t hold it in one spot or go over the same area numerous times. You can see the blood circulation it brings to the surface of your face and all of the oil it removes. It’s exciting but please don’t go overboard because you could damage your face. I have been pleasantly surprised with this product and recommend it to anyone looking to renew and resurface their face.",0,1
260,260,5,There is no such thing as a magic panacea for facial acne. Trust me I'm a 30-year-old man still dealing with it. This actually leaves my face feeling so much less greasy. And unlike soaps or chemical treatments I can adjust the oil removal myself so I'm not left feeling dry and making it worse with my body producing more oil to fix the dryness. (That is always how it feels to me)Bonus is that my usually blemish free wife used it during pregnancy and loved it! No need to meticulously read labels to ensure you are pumping harmful toxins into her body.Highly recommended.,0,1
261,261,5,"Except for some really stubborn blackheads, this device is really effective in removing blackheads and/or whiteheads from your pores. The best time to use this device is after a hot shower or steaming your pores for 5-10 minutes. Don't be gentle and press it against your face with a little force. You will feel very satisfy seeing those gunks quickly sucked out. I had the Panasonic Pore Vacuum when that came out ages ago and threw it away within days because the poor sucker did not work. This blackhead remover vacuum, however, have awesome suction power and you should get one as part of your normal beauty routine. I can definitely save a lot of money now because I don't have to pay for expensive pore extraction facials anymore.",0,1

I wasnt really sure what to expect but the instruction were really clear it has different types of suction power which was really helpful as my skin is so sensitive. I used this only one time but the result were amazing i couldnt believe how much it can clean on the nose area. I steamed my face before using to soften the blackheads and used ice after cleaning the blackheads to minimize opened pores. Looking forward to use it more.,0,1

You have to be careful not to let it sit in one spot for too long, it will turn it red for a while. I would be really interested to get a dermatologist or esthetician's thoughts on this item.

Wonderful alternative and more gentle.,0,1

His nose felt more smooth and there were less blackheads (you can literally see in the picture). Although his nose got red, the redness faded away. The suction is so powerful --there are different levels that you can set this device to, but i suggest you be careful because you can actually bruise yourself. I accidently left a mark on my nose because i set it on the highest setting, and left it in one place. I can't really blame the device because in the manual, it instructs you to not use it for long in one spot!I really love how there's various of tips that has different functions (ex. one tip is used specially for exfoliation, smaller tip is good for suction, theres an oval shaped tip). Lastly, I really like how it's usb charger, so you do not need to worry about changing batteries.Price is extremely reasonable! You will see results!",0,1
272,272,4,"I was not sure that this product would actually work, but I think it actually does! I tried it out and it does have a ton of suction power and was pulling junk off my nose (that's where I used it). My nose does look and feels smoother now so I think it did remove a lot of the blackheads. It's a little hard to get the bridge of my nose because it is just wide enough that it needs to be done separately. There are skinnier heads though that I still need to try so I am assuming those will be able to work. I don't have sensitive skin so I am not sure how good it is for people who do, but the suction power is a lot, but you can change it.",0,1
273,273,4,"Oh it works - maybe a little too well. I use it right after shower but i’m pretty sure the best method is to use a wet/warm towel over your face. It sucks up the white heads and grease - but oh my goodness - do not go past suction level 1 if you have sensitive skin and do not leave it in one spot for too long - YOU WILL BRUISE.I personally have tan skin and the bruises will last 2-3 days. Some others say it lasts 5 days so I think it just depends on your skin type. So if you’re using it for the first time, please test it on days you’re not going out (if you’re self-conscious!)After using it, follow with a toner (to minimize pores) and then moisturize. This will help prevent more whiteheads/blackheads from forming etc",0,1
274,274,5,"I love this, if you use it right after a shower/post facial steam it is best. I have used this product 1-2 times a week since purchasing and my pore size on my nose/tzone are drastically reduced, blackheads are smaller and nearly gone at this point, which is wild because that has always been my biggest problem area.. wish i had found this sooner!! I will say if you plan on buying be sure to read the instructions. They’re very thorough and will ensure that you use it properly so as to not damage your skin :) I would recommend this to anyone who has oil buildup or likes to do facial extractions at home in between formal facials :) the only thing I would change about this product is the sizing of the suction heads make it sometimes difficult to reach smaller blackhead areas on the nose, a smaller head tailored for this would improve it immensely.",0,1
275,275,5,"Great product for cleaning blackheads, I use it mainly on my nose and it works as expected.It comes will multiple heads, and you can use the device with different levels of suction, though it should not be used repeatedly and in the same area as it will leave marks, I think once a week -or 2 weeks for extra sensitive skin- will be good enough.It's a solid product, comes with good packaging and charges through USB.",0,1
276,276,5,"Really pulls up the grease on your face. Really simple to use as there are only up, down, and power buttons. Comes with different suction cups that are designed for different things, I really only used the main one. Much easier after a hot towel over area, or a hot shower to open pores. I was able to get smaller blackheads versus the larger ones. But the suction is great!",0,1
277,277,5,"I was a little skeptical about a device that could really suck up blackheads but after years of trying different products I figured I’d give it a try. WOW. I used it after I took a shower so my pores would be warm and open. It immediately worked! It sucked blackheads and whiteheads our of my nose that I’ve tried to get rid of forever. I’m so impressed. My husband even tried it and EWW it worked so well on his face, too. Love that it came in a nice storage box and is USB rechargeable. I will definitely use it often!",0,1
278,278,5,"The package was delivered on time without any issues and very neatly packed inside.The device has very strong suction power and can be adjusted to required levels. The instruction is all you need, it guided me through the whole process and how to use etc. No battery change, i just need to charge it through provided USB cable.This is a good product and I highly recommend friends or family give it a try.",0,1
279,279,5,"I received this item a few days ago and was immediately impressed with the packaging. Very nice and seemed like a high end spa item, but it was only $30! Came in a nice box and includes 4 different ""heads"" for different skin care. It is rechargeable (great feature) and has very powerful suction. You can change the suction from light to very high, but be careful, as the instructions warn, you can over do it. After some quick swipes over my forehead and T zone, I was able to see lots of dirt/dead skin coming off my face. Kind of gross but oddly satisfied to see! The entire set seems very durable and I can't wait to see how it works over several weeks/months in terms of helping with fine lines and exfoliating.Love it so far!",0,1
280,280,5,I was given this product to review for Amazon. I was a little hesitant when ordering this I didn't believe anything like this could do what it says it can. Man was I wrong I opened the box put the right suction head on turned it on and watched the magic happen. It actually sucked dirt off my face and I could see it clear a few blackheads and white heads. It is so gross but also so cool.,0,1
281,281,5,"As someone that has always struggled with clogged pores, I was skeptical. Masks, cleaners, nose strips- nothing made it better! I tentatively order this, and I am so glad I did! I will spare you the nasty photos, but know that this sucks outs tons of gross dirt and oil daily! After using this consistently, my pores are visibly smaller on my nose!If you struggle, buy this! It really works wonders!",0,1
282,282,4,This product is really cool. I have seen many videos and photos about this product so I thought I would give it a try. Let's just say I have bruises but that is okay because I held in areas for a long time for deep cleaning. There are setting on the type of suction you need and different heads for different uses. I enjoyed the deep cleaning one and the massage one the best. It relaxed me and made my face less puffy. I will be using this from time to time really enjoyed it except the bruises,0,1
283,283,1,"It suctions really well but doesn't actually suction anything out of pores. I even tried using a hot compress prior to using to open up pores. I found that it more so sucked dead skin off of my face. As many have said, it does leave bruises if you hold it on one space for too long but you can easily avoid that by keeping it in motion.",0,0
284,284,4,This little thing has a LOT of suction power!! I can’t even imagine turning it up all the way. Be careful when using. If you go over the same area more than once or go too slowly you can bruise. It was fun to play with. Used it a few times. Don’t think it really made that much of a difference. Will probably toss in the back of the closet and never use again.,0,1
285,285,5,"Bought this for my wife since she is always spending money on sticky pads for her nose and pores. This thing is amazing straight out of the box and has plenty of attachments for different contours of your face. I used it after my wife (and after cleaning it out!) and im a big fan of it to. Its pretty gratifying seeing all of the build up pulled out of your pores and the blackheads gone. Dont think twice, just get this thing and youll love it!",0,1
286,286,3,This pore vaccum worked great for me but not so much for my husband. May be because i have smaller pores and his have really impacted blackheads. Will continue to try and will see how it goes. Not as irritating as I thought it would be. Your nose gets red only momentarily and then back to normal. Overall good quality product.,0,0
287,287,5,"I was kinda sceptical about getting one of these pore vacuums, but after watching many YouTube videos and reading Amazon reviews I finally settled on buy this one. First, it came in way earlier than originally projected which is always a positive! I then took a hot shower to open my pores. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!!! For best results you really want to make sure your pores are nice and opened up. I started with the lowest intensity and it brought all the gross stuff to the surface, then bumped it up to the second (of five) intensity settings. The second setting then started to get all the dirt and black heads out of my nose and face!! I was amazed! I cleaned the little head out with a q-tip after doing my forehead a few times and what is pictured is what came out! SO GROSS! Overall, product works and I’m excited to continue using it.",0,1
288,288,5,I was skeptical of these blackhead removers but I tried these. After trying this and I took a shower and then I can see the changes on my face. It works great. I would recommend to not start immediately with stronger suction setting till you get used to it. I think the vacuum is very effective by itself. This is my first blackhead remover and it is easily washable.,0,1
289,289,1,"This product is amazing. It completely surprised me , I wasn’t going to think it would actually work but it did. I only used it for a minute or two in the areas of focus and it got a good bit. The instructions were clear and very easy to use. I tried it on my husband too and he was completely amazed. I would totally recommend this to anyone who is looking for a black head remover!",0,0
290,290,5,"I was highly surprised by this product! I used to remove my blackheads using pore strips before, but they were really painful and they irritated my skin so much when I used them. So I decided to give this product a try and I'm so glad that I did!It's really easy and intuitive to use, and it works great. It leaves you a really clean and smooth skin. The fact that it has different suction levels allows you to adapt it to your skin type (you can choose a smoother level if you have sensitive skin), so your skin doesn't get irritated at all.It also comes with 4 different heads with different shapes, so you can switch it and choose the one that works best for the area that you want to work at (plus, the curved design of the remover works great for reaching difficult spots!).Totally worth it!",0,1
291,291,5,"This is amazing! It worked great I used it on myself but not much came out since I don’t have many blackheads but I tried it on my husband and it worked great it took out a lot of blackheads that he had on his nose and he loved how clean his nose looked, also when I used it it wasn’t painful at all. I definitely recommend this and it’s not even expensive",0,1
292,292,5,So I used it the day it was delivered and yes that suction is really good i had to turn mines up to the second one but the first is still powerful suction.. this thing sucked out all my white heads on my nose ew it was gross but hey my pores are smaller and white head free.. oh I recommend steaming face or hot towel to have supple skin before suctions. It really helps open pores to get out stubborn white/black heads,0,1
293,293,1,"One the first use, lowest setting, it caused a large amount of bruising all over my face. It was terrible! Looked like hickeys all over my face. Took several days to clear up. Beware if you have any events coming up. My skin isn't typically sensitive either.",0,0
294,294,5,I love this so much! My pores are cleaner and smaller since I’ve been using it about weekly. I liked it so much I let two of my friends borrow it and one loved it but the other didn’t like it much because it didn’t get anything but I think it’s because she has really clean pores. The suction on this will leave “hickeys” if you aren’t careful. It has multiple suction settings so you can prevent that. I use it mostly on my nose and it gets that crease where my nose meets my cheek and clears those really big pores there.,0,1
295,295,5,"Wow- this little vacuum is amazing. But be careful, or you’ll give your face a hickey. My chin may have suffered a little, but I was so impressed with the horsepower behind this thing. It’s oddly gratifying seeing what this thing sucks out of your face. My face hasn’t felt this smooth in a long time. It was a little harsh on my dryer skin areas. But still rate it a 5.",0,1
296,296,5,"Like everyone, I was quite skeptical about buying a product like this. In the end, it really works. I definitely get the crap out of my nose pores using only the first or second setting. It usually leaves some bruising on my face for a day but that's when I know I overdid it. I've been too scared to try the higher setting, ha. You don't be disappointed, give it a try.",0,1
297,297,5,Amazing! This tool is the best thing I’ve used in a long time. My daughter has black heads on her nose and chin. This little gadget pulled those bad boys out in seconds! Be careful not to leave in one area too long or it can cause redness but my face and her face has improved so much since starting this! My pores are way smaller now also!!! Thank you!,0,1
298,298,5,Im a guy And I normally don't buy such things. I kinda had a problem with white heads on my nose. It wasn't bad but it was there. I'd always had to scrub it in the shower and such. Thennn I found this tool and it took me for a surprise. First of all. It's disgusting what comes out lol it cleans very well. After use. Remember to wash your face with cold water so the pourse close.,0,1
299,299,5,Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. I tried it myself and was amazed at the suction created by this pore cleaner. I was impressed since it is such a small and inexpensive item.,0,1
300,300,5,"It has very strong suction and comes with multiple sized tips for concentrated vacuum.I like the exfoliating head it comes with for removing dead skin cells. I really like that it's rechargeable and comes with cable. I suggest using steam to open up pores before using the remover, or use it after taking a shower when the skin is soft and pores are open. That's the way to get the most gunk out.",0,1
301,301,5,"This is not a magical ""fix all my acne problems"" face vaccum. Its 20 dollars and works great for that price. I have EXTREMELY fair skin, used the correct nozzle and put it on the lowest setting. My face was red for a little bit (like they warn it will be) but I had NO bruising whatsoever.My guess is that people with bruising are firmly placing it on their face, which is not recommended in the directions.It got way more gunk than I expected. I'm guilty of squeezing out my pores,which damages the skin and just makes more problems. This keeps me from doing that.Tl;dr Use it like the directions say and you won't bruise",0,1
302,302,5,I was absolutely amazed/disgusted at how much gunk this thing sucked out of my pores. I now use it weekly and have had great results. I do have sensitive skin and have had some instances of bruising after use even while using the sensitive skin tip on the lowest suction setting. Definitely use caution on your more sensitive areas but overall I am incredibly happy with this product.,0,1
303,303,5,"I have really stubborn whiteheads/blackheads on my chin, cheekbones and nose. My husband also gets pretty big blackheads on his nose since his pores are so big. This thing WORKS.Wash your face and steam open your pores. Start on the lowest suction setting and make a few passes over the area you want to clear, up the suction and repeat. It will cause a bruise if you leave it one spot for too long. To avoid this, keep the skin taught as you pass over the area.",0,1
304,304,5,Works great! Definitely make sure you use a hot towel on your face for at least five minutes. Also trying the lowest setting first it has a strong suction. Also don’t use this if you’d are going to running out the door because your skin will be a little red. Do this before bed or when your are just going to around the house so you give your skin time to “recover” you could say. I will absolutely recommend this to my friends and family!,0,1
305,305,5,"Loved this black head remover. I do have to warn you to be careful when using this. If you have it on too high of suction power, or if you leave it too long on one spot, it will leave some bruising. But I use it after a shower, and I run it across my face and works wonderfully. After I do that, I do a peeling mask and my face looks smooth.",0,1
306,306,5,I have been using this since receiving the item and it works so well! I could not believe how much gunk was in my pores. I clean my face a few times a day and would never have thought I would have that much in my face. It is very easy to use and clean. The different heads that come with it are great to have when using on areas of the face that are a bit difficult to get to. I have begun to notice the wrinkles by my eyes smoothing and how much better my skin feels already. The battery stays charged for many uses. I have only had to charge it once since receiving it and it doesn’t loose suction when the battery does go down. My friend recommended this to me and I absolutely love it!,0,1
307,307,1,"The blackhead remover is amazing. I never realized how much was in my pores. I've used pore strips in the past, but this is way better. It even comes with different heads for different situations. This is absolutely great!",0,0
308,308,4,This device is very easy to use. I was excited to receive this in the mail and as soon as I got it I opened this. The device came with multiple suction pieces and a charging USB cable which makes for easy charging. The product was already pre-charged so I washed my face and began. The suction has multiple levels to choose from. I feel like it did great cleaning my face but had some trouble getting into the curve of my nose. the suction cups are easy to remove and clean the dirty easily. This will leave your face a little red after so I recommend using it when you don't have plans to go anywhere. All in all a great product!,0,1
309,309,5,"This definitely has very strong suction. Be careful haha! I have combination skin, leaning towards dry. So I did get some junk, but not as much as I hoped I would. But I feel there is a learning curve to using the right attachments for each area I definitely woke up the next day feeling my skin looked a little better. I think the suction livened up my skin.",0,1
310,310,5,"When I order this, I was a little skeptical that this product was not going to work. To my surprise, it actually works very well! I don’t have to buy painful charcoal masks that don’t do the job well. This vacuum does exactly what it says it does. One piece of advice, start up with the lowest setting and work your way up. The first time I used it I was skeptical and decided to use it on the max setting. My nose was red for 2 days.",0,1
311,311,4,"While the suction is strong, I find the Biore strips more effective. The suction is strong and it will leave red marks on your face that are visible 6+ hours after use. It is pretty cool and gross to see all the gunk that’s in your pores. Maybe every face is different. I’ll keep it but don’t plan to use it much. Going back to the strips.",0,1
312,312,1,I liked this product it worked but the suction on it could have been better it was way to strong and the top pieces that you put on it could be made of silicone or something other then hard plastic to make it easier on your face. And also make it easier to clean.,0,0
313,313,5,"I was really skeptical, me and my husband have blackheads in our nose and nothing ever seemed to work to get them out. But this little machine really does it, it’s satisfying to see the end result in the suction cup! I wouldn’t recommend using it everyday, because it caused our nose to peel, but if you use it every couple days it was fine! Highly recommend!",0,1
314,314,5,"This little vacuum is great ! It’s super powerful. I got a little bruised the first time I used it but that was because I went over the same areas too many times . I’ve only had it about a month , and haven’t had any problem with it . It came fully charged and ready to use . I would definitely recommend using it on the lowest setting and only going over the same spot two times maximum.",0,1
315,315,5,"I have been looking for one of these products ever since the new ""craze"" of the ""blackhead vacuum"" - after reading the reviews, I chose to go with this one because of the price and recommendations. I am super glad that I chose to purchase this product. After reading the instructions, and using the correct ""heads"" for the spots on my face - I have never seen my face more clear, or felt my face more smooth. The best way to use it is right after the shower or after washing with a warm compress - make sure it it fully charged for the best results. Really works - highly recommend.",0,1
316,316,5,"As my wife seems to be very happy with this blackhead remover. She has a pick set and has been using that, but with this she says this not just reduces the pinching pain of pick n needles this infact sucks out a lot of skin oil as well. Her only concern is that this came with limited replacement foam. However she says she can make use of any foam. Good product.",0,1
317,317,5,I love this product. I have very sensitive dry skin and this does not aggravate it at all. I have only used it around the nose and chin area of my face (my troublesome and less sensitive spots) and the product has worked really well! I can see all the gunk in the green probe. My nose is noticibly less oily during the day. I have a process when I use the product that works really well for me. 1st. Wash my face with hot water ( I do not have a steamer) to open my pores. 2nd. Use the black head remover on my nose and chin. 3. Use a cotton ball with apple cider vinegar in the same area to clean the oils and pores. 4. Use coconut oil or rosehip oil to sooth the skin. I would recommend this product and already have told my friends and family about how great it works!,0,1
318,318,4,"This blackhead remover is great at removing those stubborn blackheads as well as whiteheads. It’s also good at overall cleansing the face of dirt, makeup, oil, dead skin, etc. It has several different suction settings so it can suction from low to high depending on how stubborn your blackheads are or depending on your needs. It also has four different suction heads as well. It’s really been a great help to my skin.",0,1
319,319,5,"This life saver arrived a few hours ago and was so happy with the results that I have to review it!It will remove all of those black head! It feels like you are doing it as a professional, you can go as high or low as you want to and make sure to apply a toner afterwards!Good luck and hopefully you’ll love it like me!",0,1
320,320,5,I actually just raved on my website about how awesome this tool is if used correctly!It sucks up just enough to get the dirt out of your pores but doesn't strip your skin of the natural oils. I have bruised a little because of it but had the power too high in too sensitive areas. I also find that the area heals super fast because you're not over damaging the skin.,0,1
321,321,5,"*Picture of the crap from my nose alone after my first use*I'm addicted to this thing. I used it right away and it did not disappoint. And now i find myself using it (on my nose especially) probably every 3 days. I tested the different suction strengths on my inner arm just to see how strong they were and settled on a level 2 or sometimes 3 for my face. I only use on my chin, forehead and nose. I avoid the more delicate skin under/next to my eyes and jaw line. Some redness that passes quickly after. I've recommended it to everyone. It's super satisfying to see all that crap it gets out of my pores.",0,1
322,322,5,I was searching for a deep pore cleansing device that actually works as advertised and it is gentle on the face. The search stopped when I came across this one and I can say that it is an amazing device that works as advertised. It cleans gentle and the skin will look normal within minutes after use.I would highly recommend this product!,0,1
323,323,4,"I have chronic blackheads on my nose. Not noticeable to others but I can see my pores everyday. This did a good job of cleaning out my pores so that they appeared smaller. I really liked it for the crease of my nostrils because it's difficult to use other tools there and it's a problem area for me. The vacuum really got a lot of gunk out of those pores. I probably waited too long after showering so my pores weren't as open as they could have been. I'm excited to try it again, though. May sure that you have some alcohol and Q-tips to clean the suction caps after each use.",0,1
324,324,5,This has different levels of intensity so you can adjust according to skin type. Works really well but have to be constantly moving it along your face. I may or may not have gotten distracted on the highest level and given my chin a hickey. But it just goes to show how well this product works!!,0,1
325,325,5,"The exfoliating brush didn’t work that well for me, but I’m going to give it another try could be user error.However- all three of the other cup sizes were great. I have tried strips, masks, home remedies- this device really worked. The suction is so powerful that I couldn’t use it on full power.I highly recommend this to anyone with blackhead problems!",0,1
326,326,4,It really doesn't remove the black heads do much as bring the crap to the surface to make them easier to pop your self. If you leave it in one area for more than like 3 seconds...you will get a hickey. I'm surprised how quickly it gives you one.I have not tried the other features...only the black head removing.,0,1
327,327,5,"Bought this on a whim for blackheads on my nose t zone that would not budge and would should through my foundation when my makeup set in and creased after a few hours. Do not want that look at 8 hour job where clientele can see that nasty detail. I bought this and received it 2 days with prime, very easy to use and removed most of the black heads on my nose that I have been trying to get rid of for weeks, within minutes. And it comes with 4 different types of heads to use to your liking! Nice to have this to add to my skincare collection and skin routine!",0,1
328,328,5,"Why did I wait so long to buy this product?! I have large, deep pores and various kinds of acne. The main thing I wanted this for was to get the gunk out of the pores in my nose so I could give them a chance to shrink. What I learned: those suckers refill almost daily with compacted skin cells and oil! No wonder strips, masks, and washing alone didn't work! It's only been about a week, but I'm already noticing a difference in pore size.It's also been super effective in getting the T-zone area of my forehead free of buildup enough for my facial products to work, but I haven't quite got the hang of using it on my chin yet. Given more time I'm sure this product will make all the difference for my skin!",0,1
329,329,5,I like my deep cleansing facials every month but it’s not easy to find an esthetician that does this well. I wish I knew about this handy tool to remove the blockages in the pores especially around the nose. The first low setting is strong enough for my needs. Teenagers would benefit from this. Happy with this product.,0,1
330,330,1,"I like how simple it is to use, the booklet it comes with answered pretty much all of my questions, mainly the little sponge in the end of the suction part.Update: worked great, if I had to nitpick problems or things I would like to see improved on, I would've liked it to feel more solid. If I grip it a certain way I can feel/hear creaks from it. I would've also liked it to come with something to clean the nozzles, I've been using cotton swabs which is fine, but something extra would've been nice.",0,0
331,331,5,"I never thought these things really worked, but I was wrong! This thing really does the trick. Be cautious of the sucking power and duration you leave it in a certain spot or you may get a little hickie lol! I've had white heads in my chin forever and I could never get them out. The area was so textured and I hated it. Now it's smooth! Exfoliate with warm water first to open pores, then watch those babies come out! I finally got the whiteheads out of the corner sides of my nose! It works fast and is easy to use. I'm excited to use it again.",0,1
332,332,5,"I've never tried a blackhead vaccum but this works really well! The suction can be very strong so the max i put the suction on is 3 but use it mostly on level 2. Be careful as this WILL make your face red, as they all should do, but it will go away. Make sure not to stay in the same spot to prevent the redness from staying too long. It's super satisfying to just get rid of all the blackheads. It's a good price for what you get as well",0,1
333,333,5,"I was a little afraid because of the reviews saying two opposite things, either that it doesn't work or that it left red marks all over their faces. But I found neither to be true. I'm using level 3 suction for my nose and lvl 2 for the rest of my face (avoiding sensitive areas like right under the eyes of course) and it is working great! My nose feels very clean with some repeated use (using once a week after long hot shower). I was also afraid that it would stretch out my pores even more with the harsh suction but that doesn't seem to be the case. Overall I'm very happy with the purchase and it works much better than nose strips.",0,1
334,334,5,I’ve been on a binge of trying out different products for my skin. Blackhead vacuum worked very well with my sensitive oily skin and having the option to choose between three different power levels was great. What I like about it most is that its very light weight and portable. I let my girlfriend borrow it for her trip to Korea and packing it away was super easy and didnt take up too much space in her luggage. At this price point I dont think you could find a better deal.,0,1
335,335,5,"Pros: This is an amazing way to clean blackheads off of your face! There was no scarring or marks left over! And with a few simple sweeps most of the blackheads are gone!Cons: The suction power is great! I just wish they had a more powerful suction for the back for those who suffer from back acne. If they come out with one for the back, I will def be getting it!",0,1
336,336,5,This is a great product. Very happy with this one compared to others that I have used before in the past. The battery life is incredible. The suction is good. I did learn the hard way however to not let it sit in one place for more than about a second especially on sensitive areas of skin like the neck. I have sensitive skin to begin with and I ended up with bruising that almost looked like a small hickey lol. I turned the suction down a notch and don't hold it in one place for very long more of a moving motion and haven't had that problem a second time.,0,1
337,337,1,I have had my friend use one of these on me before and it was amazing but she paid upwards of $200 for it! I thought this would be a nice cheap replica but unfortunately it was not. Every time I use it my face breaks out with pimples. A few times the suction would get stuck and end up giving you a hickey. I had multiple people try it out and they all got pimples. It did get rid of gunk and whiteheads but it’s not worth the breakouts.,0,0
338,338,2,"This has a very powerful suction, the lowest suction is strong enough. I gave it several tries and even watched in the magnifying mirror. It did not remove the black heads. It has the potential to really damage and stretch your skin. My package came unsealed and without directions. Since I have had this professionally done, I knew how to use it.I am returning because I thought it removed the black heads easily. I even tried doing this right after the shower so as to loosen the blackheads and it still didn’t remove them. The exfoliating attachment was the only attachment that can receive credit for removing dead skin. But still one must be very careful when doing it. I always used the lowest suction.",0,0
339,339,1,I used a face steamer and it hardly took out anything from my pores. I followed all instructions but it just didn’t work. I’m very disappointed. I’ve lowered the stars because I’ve been continually hounded by the seller to delete my review and they have not agreed to my terms in regards to fixing the situation.,1,0
340,340,5,This product is AMAZING. I bought it because of its amazing reviews and it’s just superb. The blackheads on my nose have been a problem all of my life but not anymore. After a shower I use it and then put cold water on my face and the pores are shrinking everyday. The suction is awesome and it’s so easy to use it’s insane!! 5/5 I HIGHLY RECOMMEND,0,1
341,341,5,"I tried this on my face. Nothing, I have tiny pores, it has great suction but couldn't pull anything out. My husband, on the other hand, has large pores. It works like a charm. Oh my gosh. It pulls it out so much stuff. He now uses it once every few days and has no more blackheads. He absolutely loves it.",0,1
342,342,5,I love this product!!! Clearer skin after a few uses and I could definitely see the difference! It has different levels for suction so you have options for your skin. It is also very easy to clean. I use to a q-tip to clean it out and you can see everything that just came out of your face. I would recommend this product to everyone especially to young people who need help with getting clear skin because of acne.,0,1
343,343,1,"After using for 2 months, my skin looks no different, the only thing that was ever removed was left over soap. Now I wash my face better and it removes nothing.",0,0
344,344,5,This product came in very nice packaging for the price. The blackhead remover vacuum surprised me when I got it with how well it is made. It is very sturdy and feels good in your hand. You can tell that the remover was made with quality craftsmanship. The suction power is great with I believe off of the top of my head 5 different settings. It comes with multiple heads that are easily cleaned. This product work very well for those pesky blackheads on your nose. I would definitely recommend.,0,1
345,345,4,"I wasn't expecting the power this machine has. Even on the softest setting, it had some suction. I havent been impressed with the outcome as it doesn't seem to pull much from my face, but it could be that I just don't have much to pull out. Anyway...if youre looking for suction power...you will not be disappointed",0,1
346,346,5,This black head remover thing is reallyCool it is really good suction power to remover those nasty blackheads maybe even prevent further ones coming out! It does leave your face red for about 30 mins after so if you want to do this give yourself time to have the redness go away it’s very easy to use and take apart for cleaning,0,1
347,347,1,"I have used this product 2-3x a week depending on how my skin is. I've tried out all the different heads and the suction is great! Best results happen after I have steamed my face, so like after a hot shower or a hot compress. It gets out all of the extra gunk and hard to get spots on my face and helps me keep clean and clear. (Much less painful than regular picking at my face!) Absolutely a go to for my facial care regime!",0,0
348,348,5,"This little thing is awesome. I haven't had issues with bruising like others, but I also don't use it on the highest suction level or keep it in one spot. I keep it moving and wow! My chin and nose has always been an issue and this thing cleans them right up. I follow up with my normal skin care routine.",0,1
349,349,5,The price on this is pretty good comparing to what others are selling it. The price isn’t to high or to low it’s just right. This product worked perfectly fine for removing some blackheads. I would definitely recommend you to start at the lowest setting the first couple of times you use this because it can be pretty powerful. Also do not leave for a long time in one are because it may bother your skin if you leave for to long or at a very high setting.,0,1
350,350,5,"I was skeptical about this product, but after reading other reviews and seeing the logic behind the product I decided to go ahead and purchase. I have to say I'm very pleased!!!! I would show pictures of the stuff that came out my pore but lets just say you won't believe that this stuff is in your pores. I go to the gym Mon, Wed, and Fri so I use it Tues , thurs, and Sat. I have already seen a noticeable difference in the look and feel of my skin. I would highly recommend this product!! However ,other reviewers saying that you DON'T STAY ON ONE SPOT TO LONG IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE!! The suction is powerful as it should be. Overall a great product and a great addition to your skin care regimen.",0,1
351,351,5,"This is great and it actually works! I absolutely reccomend it with a steamer. Doesn't pull out anything deep (like whiteheads) but cleans the surface blackheads pretty well.I saw some of the other reviews complain about bruising. Yes, if you set it to a high suction and hold it on your skin it for a while it will very obviously bruise. If you have common sense you should be able to avoid the bruising.",0,1
352,352,4,"I usually have a lot of blackheads on my nose, and this product worked really well for me. Personally I have had some hard times getting some blackheads because of the location on my nose but this product has really helped! It's helped me get a lot of the harder to get blackheads on my nose and overall took care most all of the blackheads. Would recommend if you have a lot of blackheads on your nose!",0,1
353,353,4,"Purchased this for the title- blackhead remover. This product has a lot of power, however we did not find with use that it actually removed blackheads. We have only had this product for a week, so maybe a few uses are required to start to really see results. With the power/ suction, I can't help but to think it has to be removing something, but I just couldn't see the results yet.",0,1
354,354,5,I’ve been waiting for something like this since I was a teenager! I used to get expensive facials and they were so painful. This device is a game-changer! Love how easy it is to use and how strong you can set it. It’s incredible what comes out in the tip! Told my sister about it and she got one too. So happy with it.,0,1
355,355,4,Steamed my face for three minutes to open up my pores. The suction power is great. If you are looking for something that has great suction power this is the product for you. I only had to use the power on the second setting (5 total). There are multiple suction caps which is good for different functions. My skin became a little red but that’s normal. Just don’t leave it in one spot for more than 3 seconds. Mostly removed the dirt and white heads. Black heads are deeper and harder to remove. If you turn up the suction power you can probably get them out but will probably get bruised badly. The instructions provided are very clear and simple to follow. Very satisfied with product!,0,1
356,356,5,"Came with a charge which was awesome! Great suction, was strong enough to leave a mark on high and left on too long. Not complaining at all worked great and all the attachments are nice. It also came with detailed instructions on what and how to use each attachments!! All in all great buy!!",0,1
357,357,5,I like all the attachments that came with this. It came precharged and in very nice packaging. My husband and me both use it. I’ve noticed less breakouts and more skin firming about my crows feet area. His face seems less greasy since starting.,0,1
358,358,4,They're not kidding when they say this can leave bruises across your face! Definitely follow the instructions. This does a good enough job for what I paid and what I expected. It helps keep my blackheads at bay. It doesn't get rid of all of them but it keeps them from surfacing. I'd recommend this product for regular maintenance and upkeep.,0,1
359,359,4,This is a neat product. I've used it a few times and it really gets a lot of gunk out of my skin. My skin feels softer and looks great! It does leave my skin a little red for a couple hours after use but after that it looks good. It works better on my skin than my husband's but it's probably because mine is softer. It's harder to get the blackheads out of his skin.,0,1
360,360,5,"Alright I was skeptical. I have acne prone, sensitive skin. Normally my focus is keeping the painful cystic acne under control, so my blackheads just kind of get swept under the rug. Saw an ad for this guy online and thought why not. It's great! My boyfriend and I boiled water on the stove and steamed our faces for 5-10 minutes and then went to town. If you use a mirror you can literally watch the blackheads pull out of your pores. It also pulls grease which is interesting. I can definitely see how you could end up with bruising if you aren't intentional while you're using it, the suction is no joke. I'll be adding it to my regimen.It came in legitimate packaging, fully charged and ready to go.",0,1
361,361,5,This product has very strong sucking power and gets rid of dry flakey skin as well. It leaves you with an overall clean feeling face.TIPS:1 - don't hover in one section for too long otherwise it says red for a while2 - do this after you shower/ have opened up your pores and it will work better: (it's not a miracle product that can suck any and everything out of your face)3 - read online reviews for instructions because my instruction packet didn't make sense and half of the guide was misprinted,0,1
362,362,4,I wanted it to work so much more than what it did. It definitely took out blackheads from my nose & chin but probably the same amount as a pore strip does. You also have to be careful I had it on a high setting & placed it on my forehead between my eyes & instantly got a bruise. So u want to control the settings depending on the area of your face.,0,1
363,363,5,this pore suction works amazingly well! It cleaned out all of my little blackheads on my nose! Very happy with this. Just a heads up do not hold it in one spot for too long or you'll have a suck mark in that area!! But the battery life is great and the different suction speeds was brilliant!! Definitely recommend this!,0,1
364,364,5,"While I cannot attest to the long-term benefits of using this product, I can say the suction is very strong and after only the first use my skin felt rejuvenated like the circulation had improved or something. After using for a week, the pores on my nose appear smaller and I've had trouble with them for years!",0,1
365,365,4,"It does exactly what it says it does. It sucks the ugly out of your face. My face felt so smooth afterwards. Only thing, I used the lowest setting and it still left some decent hickies on my face. I never left it suctioning on one spot. I constantly moves it around. Either way, it did its job",0,1
366,366,5,"This is awesome. My husband and I love the different settings. It really does minimize the pores and it tackles my most stubborn blackheads. I find it works best if you use right after a shower. It does leave red marks if you have sensitive skin but it goes away after a day. I have used this on my back, neck, face and chest and it’s amazing. Tip:DO NOT LEAVE IN ONE SPOT TOO LONG.",0,1
367,367,5,"I was hesitant at first but after deciding to get it, this thing really works. The results are pretty disgusting but that's less nastiness in my pores! I only use it on my nose because my pores there are larger and clog up quicker. Do note that it seems to only work on blackheads and not full on white head pimples. I only use one of the attachments since I only do one area with consistent skin conditions. There battery life is great and it's really handy having it charged with micro USB. Overall, I highly recommend this product for clearing pores. Much easier than strips or a mask.",0,1
368,368,5,This product has been a beneficial addition to my skin care routine. I use it everyday after my shower and it’s amazing how much it can pick up. It does not pull out every blackhead on its path but it does pick excess dead skin and oils on your face which will build up to become blackheads.,0,1
369,369,5,"Works great on the chin and nose,but if you have a couple deep pores you are gonna have to get those out manually with a blackhead pick. As for using it on the rest of the face I didn't really get anything out which information mind because I mostly wanted this for my nose and chin.",0,1
370,370,5,"I've been seeing these devices popup every where and was hesitant to try it. After hearing that some of my coworkers used and liked the product, I decided to give it a try. The suction is no joke and I slightly bruised the side of my nose. Definitely start the suction on the lower settings while you figure out the pressure and speed.I've been impressed with how well it actually pulls gunk from my pores. My pores on my nose and chin have been bothering me but after using this I feel like I am noticing them less and less.",0,1
371,371,5,"It's like magic! It sucks the nasty stuff out of the pores. It was gratifying to see myself saying the same thing. I've noticed that with this stuff, the pores become smaller and less visible. I think it's also much less damaging to the skin, as opposed to squeezing out blackheads or scraping them. You absolutely need to add this sucker to your beauty regimen. Your skin will thank you!",0,1
372,372,5,"This item was nicely packed and come with three adjustable suctions. I like that it has massaging and Exfoliating feathers. I have a very sensitive skin, and often have breakouts, so I put a warm towel on my face to open my pores a few minute before the blackhead remover. It did remove out some grease and blackheads, then I followed by a face mask that I kept in the refrigerator to keep it cool. I feel like my skin is so much more soft and clean after doing this.I definitely recommend this product to anyone who has oily skin, or anybody who struggles with black heads.",0,1
373,373,5,"This product is a miracle!! I have always had big open pores due to genetics and because I have oily skin, I always had blackheads and whiteheads all over my face but especially on my nose and cheeks.I got tired of trying to pop or squeeze out blackheads and kind of succumbed to cleaning my face as best as a I could and just let it be. But this product changed everything! My face has never looked or felt smoother before! I also love the exfoliating head that is supposed to help with fine lines. I do it every other day and have really noticed a difference on a line I have on my forehead. I absolutely recommend and am buying one for my husband as well!",0,1
374,374,5,"Exceeded my expectations for the price. I mainly use it for my nose and it unclogged my pores so well. The suction power is strong enough to remove the most stubborn blackheads. It does leave a red mark after the first use but after a few uses the skin gets used to it which is normal. For the price, you are getting an amazing product.",0,1
375,375,5,"So I have pretty sensitive skin and so does my 14 year old. I originally wanted to order this for him. He gets little black heads along his forehead/hair line and in his ears. This helped suck some out without having to squeeze them. He gets super annoyed What I have him squeeze them. Even in his ear this helped get some of those ones out as well.The first one that was shipped only worked on one setting. I contacted them and received my new one the following day. Just have to return to detective one now. Overall, I feel this product helps. It seemed to work best after steam/warm water shower.",0,1
376,376,4,"This does suck out those pesky whiteheads that come up all the time. It did not take out my larger blackheads,but you coups tell that there was gunk in the suction head (which was easy to clean out.) causes a slight redness when used on setting 2 and up, which quickly goes away.",0,1
377,377,4,"The suction is more intense than I expected, even on the lowest setting. There’s definitely a learning curve at first. My initial impression after using it was that it is only effective in that the suction is causing the tool to scrape along the skin, making it no better that those exfoliating razors. When I woke up the next day though, my typically oily skin did not look oily at all, so this thing obviously was pulling up oil from deeper into my pores. An exciting new tool! (No embarrassing pictures included, but this thing pulled up some stuff! Ew)",0,1
378,378,5,"So I was skeptical to buy a pore vacuum because all the negative reviews of them online, but I really wanted to try it. I bought one that was fairly inexpensive in hopes I wouldn’t waste too much money. To my surprise , this thing is absolutely awesome! It is really important to prep your skin first. I used a facial steamer for about ten minutes right before I used the vacuum. If you don’t have one use a hot towel. Make sure your skin is a bit damp when you use it, and don’t keep it in one place too long. My nose hasn’t looked this clear since before puberty! If you use this product correctly, you will not be disappointed.",0,1
379,379,5,"I was pleasantly surprised to find that this small yet powerful vacuum includes 4 different attachments - each for a slightly different purpose. Per included instructions, this device can be used for more than just cleaning black-heads: it's also promotes skin rejuvenation. Only used it twice and seeing noticeable results; and without pinching my skin I'm not injuring myself as I used to... Important to note that suction is very strong, so as recommended in instruction, it should be held in one spot for more than 3 seconds. Otherwise you may get a ""hicky"" effect which may last for many hours...",0,1
380,380,5,I’m skeptical to get this item at first but this is indeed a great buy! The suction power is strong and the fact that you can adjust it to your liking and need is amazing. What I love the most about this thing is the massage/ exfoliating feature. It is cool and very relaxing.,0,1
381,381,5,"I’ve always had issues with my nose blackheads and have been trying different removers for some time now. This has by far been the most usable! Initially I got scared because my nose got red, but then noticed that the area was so much cleaner than before. Absolutely satisfied! It has multiple suctions for different areas that are easy to clean! I’m thankful that I didn’t have to spend a lot of money on this either because it’s usually very frustrating to find something reasonable as well as something that actually works!",0,1
382,382,5,"Wow! I bought this for my teenage son who has some blackheads. Before trying it on him, I tried it on myself. I used the suction on the lowest setting and got more dirt than I realized I had. Be careful with the suction like other reviewers have mentioned...too much and you can give yourself a bruise.",0,1
383,383,2,"The suction is very strong on this item, but I don't see where it gets the black heads out. I'm not sure how many times or for how long people are using the item to get the blackheads gone, but from the comments I've read I thought that it took them out as soon as you use it. I've used it several times on the same area and still have the blackheads there. Although the suction is very strong it is NOT taking out the blackheads.",0,0
384,384,5,Wow this little device has some power! Opening the box (pictured) I was surprised how well structured and made this products is. I used it yesterday on the lowest setting and wow that's all you need. Follow the directions and move across your skin as it will give you a hickie quick. It does cause a little redness so I would reccomend doing it at night before bed. Very glad I purchased and added it to my facial routine and trying all the options it has,0,1
385,385,5,"I have always wanted one of these tools but have never actually believed that it would help the condition of my skin. I am in my mid 20's and I don't have much acne but I do have bumpy, red skin and the occasional clogged pore. I started using this product about a month ago and I followed the instructions and have noticed a difference in the overall look and feel of my skin. My plan is to continue to use this little sucker, I am very happy with this purchase!",0,1
386,386,5,Works very well. I loved the many heads and adjustable suction. Make sure to use when pores are open for maximum effect.,0,1
387,387,3,"So the product box comes unsealed which seems like everyone else's are, but box has a weird dried smudge on the back and the charging hole on my suction device has scratches and a tiny chip around it. It appears to still work but if it's a refurbished product, it should be sold at a reasonable price. Maybe testing was a little rough on it?",0,0
388,388,5,The suction power on this is very powerful! I only used the first two settings and TMI but I was shocked at how much came out of my T-zone alone. There are 4 heads that serve different purposes but my favorites are the ones for pore cleaning. I'm very pleased with this purchase!,0,1
389,389,1,"If I could give this zero stars I would. I started of with the lowest setting and it gave me bruises on the first try, it didn’t even get any of the whiteheads.I followed the directions and even had a warm towel on for 5 minutes to prep my skin but it didn’t work. I don’t even have sensitive skin and this just gave me a painful experience.Will be returning.",0,0
390,390,5,Received the product right away and tried immediately. It clearly works!,0,1
391,391,5,"This blackhead remover vacuum works great for my mildly clogged pores. I've always had large pores which makes it easy for them to get filled up and scrubbing cleansers are just not enough to remove them, but this vacuum is. I would take caution the first time using it, because the suction can be really strong and if you stay in one spot for too long you can definitely leave a mark. I washed my face, pat dried it and then used the medium suction power at a rate of one second/inch (guessing) and applied a sheet face mask for 10 mins afterwards to calm some of the redness, washed it off and felt great.",0,1
392,392,5,This is a great product. It really gets the junk of my face. Be very careful not to leave it in one place to long. You will look like you have hickies in weird spots if you do. I use mine on a day I know I'm not going anywhere because it can leave your face a little red.,0,1
393,393,5,"Got this for my best friend for Christmas 2019 and she lovessss it. She has oily skin and is very prone to acne. There are options for suction and deep scrub. After the first use, her face is glowinggg. Excellent product!! Worth the buy. Don't hesitate you won't regret.",0,1
394,394,5,This is amazing! I’ve always had a hard time exfoliating my face especially around my nose but this device works wonders! Super easy to use and works very well. It works best after a hot shower before bed so your face can rest a while before putting any make up on. I love the exfoliating tip it comes with too. This product is definitely worth it!,0,1
395,395,5,It's great to be able to see an acne product working. You can't really do that with the topical creams or other acne treatments. Very easy to use. It works extra well if you steam your face beforehand to open up the pores and put a cold washcloth on after to close them back up.,0,1
396,396,5,I can’t with this product. I am very strict in the reviews I give and don’t give 5 stars to something if it isn’t really amazing. This product is!! I’ve already shared the link with like 5 friends and told them they should buy it because I love it so much!Be careful with the suction mode because it left my face all red the first time haha (my fault),0,1
397,397,5,"As a boy of strawberry nose, he always hopes to get rid of the strawberry nose one day, but he didn't expect the effect to surprise me. When he first used it, he saw a lot of black heads being sucked out. At that time, his eyes were shining. I couldn't believe that he could suck out so many black heads. After cleaning some of them, he was stubborn. I would use the big suction head to slide in the place of black heads several times The sample is sucked out, the effect is very good, recommend to buy",0,1
398,398,4,"Blackhead remover has good suction and gets out oil. For myself and my husband, it did not actually remove any actual blackheads though. Product is easy to use and has several suction levels to find the one that works best for you. Did not bruise or leave red marks afterwards.",0,1
399,399,5,This product is really useful for blackheads on your nose. I am always having to push and squeeze on my nose. I finally decided to try this nifty little device. It works really good. I was able to clear some of my pores on my nose. You do need to be careful and not leave it in one spot too long or you will bruise.,0,1
400,400,5,"Very easy to use. The highest setting really does suck debris from your pores. I like to hold the suction tip level with my skin until it sucks in, then gently drag it along my skin while maintaining the suction seal. I plan to use this product once a week on my nose and chin.",0,1
401,401,5,"I saw this on an article BuzzFeed. I will just say I am BLOWN AWAY at how great this thing works. I have a lot of congestion on my nose and chin, but NOT ANYMORE thanks to this baby! Suction power is stronger than I thought (learned this after I left my nose all red and purple) so I had to turn it down a notch. I’m so glad I bought this. I was surprised it was inexpensive too. I thought it wouldn’t be good quality/ ineffective. But boy was I wrong! You won’t see me at any expensive facial place any time soon!",0,1
402,402,5,Just received.. it came in beautiful packageI on it and to my surprise it was charged.. ready for use. It has so good suction cup and power. Easy to clean and easy to useJust keep rolling as it might make a mark which ll go away after some time if Made,0,1
403,403,4,I think this is a great product for people that need deep cleaning. I put this away because i dont have time to use it and i just used it once. its kind of harsh on me because the suction is too strong. if the seller is willing to take it back. i would like that. but overall i think its a good product but not for me.,0,1
404,404,5,Best product I have yet to have to remove blackhead. They give you different size heads to do different areas of your face. Most definitely would buy this product again totally worth every penny. The first picture is after three days all the black heads are gone. The second picture is from before I started it. Totally love this item if looking for a good black head remover this is the one for you. They put different levels of suction which was very nice and very helpful. Very easy to use. Totally gonna buy another one if I have too,0,1
405,405,5,"This pore vacuum is legit! I steamed my face with a washcloth for roughly ten minutes prior to using it. I definitely noticed that the sides of my nose extracted much easier than the spots on my cheeks. I followed the instructions and didn’t leave it on my skin longer than the recommended 3 seconds. I have extremely sensitive skin and was able to use at the highest setting without any bruising. My face was slightly red afterwards, but faded soon after!I definitely want to try this with a face steamer to see if that would help with areas other than my nose!I give it 5 stars!",0,1
406,406,5,I wanted to wait and test out this machine before I left a review but I have been using for 4 weeks and I already can see such a difference!! This one really does work! Powerful multi setting auction and multiple size heads for the most suction on certain parts of your face. I think it works best after a nice hot shower you will see the gunk from your problem areas that comes out with this. They say these types of treatments take 8 weeks for the best results and I’m only half way through and loving my skin!!! Definitely recommend this product!!!!,0,1
407,407,5,"it really has a good suction which helps a lot for blackheads.having different cap helps to cover all over the nose.it really helps more if you first go to the sauna or shower so the pores open completely then use this device.Do not suction all over the face just where you have blackheads.After more than a month of using this device, I can say that it worth to try and It really helps to smooth my nose!It would be good if you use 2 times a week!overally I can say I am happy with this purchase",0,1
408,408,5,"This thing is amazing! I used it the day I got it because I wanted to see if it actually worked. I clean my face really regularly but still have those little blackheads. I was still able to clean my nose and forehead even more. I showed my husband and he wanted to try it. He works outside and isn't as great about washing, the amount of ""stuff"" that he got out was insane! He has been using it every night now!",0,1
409,409,5,"This is a pretty handy little device that works exactly as advertised. It’s more effective and economical than using pore strips (Which are limited in where you can place them, and tend to pull hairs too). I’m very happy with this purchase and would recommend.",0,1
