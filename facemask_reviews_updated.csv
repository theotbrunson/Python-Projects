0,5,"This blackhead mask is very easy to be put on the nose and cheek. You can use about 10-15 times with this bottle of blackhead mask. You don't need a lot to be put on your nose because it spreads very easy. You can wait 10-15 minutes. When you peel it off, please peel it slowly so the blackheads can be taken out.

23,2,"I really wanted to love this product. It smells great... but it did NOT work as advertised. I tried the mask thick, I tried the mask thin, I tried it with a clean freshly scrubbed face, I tried it with a face that was overdue for a shower, I tried peeling it at the recommended time, I tried giving over an hour of extra drying time... it didn‚Äôt do anything for my blackheads.My skin is dry/oily combo. I have a mix of blackheads that stick out and can easily be plucked with a pair of tweezers. I also have blackheads that sit in large pores and love to burst out when a little pressure is applied to the surrounding skin. You would think my skin would be the perfect candidate for a mask the ‚Äúsucks blackheads out‚Äù ... but no, it just sucks and the blackheads sit back and laugh, cozy in my pores.It‚Äôs too expensive to buy for its nice masculine woodsy aroma, which I do really love. But I want and need a mask for blackhead removal. This mask is not the one. My search shall continue. üò¢",0,0

28,1,The only thing it pulled off was my little hairs blackheads where untouched. Probably would have done a better job with elmers glue. On top of that even after eating for it to dry it still left product still on me. I had to scrub it off and still have to deal with the blackheads,0,0

When I saw the box i was very skeptical, because it was incredibly small. and then when i opened the box the bottle was the size of my hand ( mind you, i have VERY small hands). When i put the mask on my face it was fairly easy to do. i let it dry and when i started peeling it off and i almost cried! i tried putting water on it but it only made it stickier. after i finally forced myself to rip the whole thing off, i realized that my face has several red bumps on my face ( i tested it before hand on my arm since i have sensitive skin, once it dried i just took it off, assuming that everything was fine.) it also didn‚Äôt work at allüòÇ",0,0

34,3,"Ow ow ow ow OWWWW! Well it‚Äôs a mask. And it peels off. No good or bad scent to it, not really any scent at all. Me and my brother used to use our mothers peel off masks for fun when we were kids cuz we thought it was cool how it looked like u were peeling off ur skin(it was a clear aloe face mask). Thought I‚Äôd try it out now as an adult to help clean out pores.If u have any peach fuzz on ur face at all MAKE SURE U SHAVE THAT STUFF OFF FIRST! I did not consider peach fuzz would b a problem since i don‚Äôt have much and it‚Äôs not really visible. Holy crap it definitely made a difference. Because of those tiny peach fuzz hairs it felt like i was actually peeling the skin off my face. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll b using peel off masks again LOL.

37,2,"I wanted to try this type of mask for a while. I was a little underwhelmed with my experience of this particular brand. It operated somewhat like a wax strip for tiny hairs on my face that I didn't know existed. While I don't have a particular problem with that, it did nothing for the blackheads, and I did use a warm towel as a compress for close to ten minutes prior to using the mask. Perhaps it would be more efficient if I used it after a longer shower. I'm not excited to try it again, though, because of the way it smelled once it had been on my face for a little while and was still drying. It smelled basically like elmer's glue. It has a nice fresh scent when applying, so I was surprised when the smell changed, and it kind of ruined the whole 'pampering yourself' experience. I read quite a few reviews before purchasing, and no one mentioned this. So, I don't know if it's just the batch I happened to get or if everyone is leaving positive reviews because they offer a $10 gift card if you post a review. Either way, I wouldn't buy it again because elmer's glue is cheaper.",0,0

40,5,"Awesome! I absolutely love using this mask! This is my first mask of this type and I have recommended to everyone I know. It‚Äôs a bit weird to get out (very gooey, yet thick), so be careful not to have it pointed down when you open, otherwise it can come out uncontrollably. Just open with cap up and lightly squeeze a bit out at a time. Try to apply rather quickly as it begins to set some rather quickly. Once it‚Äôs on it‚Äôs great and you can feel it tightening some, then when it‚Äôs done it will feel smooth and may start peeling some when you flex your face.For the most part it does/wants to come off in a single piece, so definitely be patient and please avoid eyebrows!Face feels great afterwards, no problems with my sensitive skin (I get psoriasis on my face and neck). Peels easily, but enough to get gunk out of pores that are ready to release it. Removes dead skin and hidden dirt well. Won‚Äôt get all the blackheads at once, but it‚Äôs still much better than without the mask.Overall, I highly recommend it! I know my mom is ready to try some herself. Great company and customer service!",0,1
41,4,I purchased this product for my teenage son because he was complaining about blackheads on his nose. I purchased the pore vacuum hand held device but that did not work well so I decided to give this product a try and IT WORKED! He said it feels so good when he is peeling it off and can feel all the black head getting sucked out. He has been using it once every 3-4 days and now his nose is blackhead free!,0,1
42,3,"I've only used this product once so far, but I am pretty satisfied. It says to apply a thick layer, but I'm thinking that maybe I applied it a little too thick because it took a lot longer than 10-15 minutes to dry. The areas of my face that I put a thinner layer on got really tight and it did peel off easily in those areas. I didn't see as many blackheads come out as I was hoping, but it definitely ripped out any facial hair I had. The scent is very strong, and it smells more like a typical male product. It has a cooling feeling to it that was a little overwhelming at first, but it calmed down the longer it was on my skin. I washed my face prior to using, and I rinsed my face off after peeling just to be sure. It didn't feel like there was any leftover residue, but I really wanted to get the scent off.",0,0

44,5,"This is my third time purchasing this mask! I use it weekly to maintain peach fuzz and clogged pores. This is one of my must haves when traveling and I would recommend anyone to give it a try!I steam my face for about 10 minutes over a small bowl of boiled water, pat dry, apply the mask and turn on a movie! When it dries I remove it and finish with a moisturizer or a hydration mask!",0,1
45,1,"I‚Äôve been using Boscia black peel mask for years but opted for a cheaper version... the first time I used this mask, it was great. My skin looked brighter, smoother and all around just better. ‚ÄîDefinitely intense and even rips off the baby hairs on your face.The second time I did it, I had a bad reaction and my skin broke out all over. I was in denial, thinking maybe it was just some freak thing unrelated (hormones, stress, etc.) and so a couple days ago I tried a third time and my skin broke out all over again.I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it after my experience, honestly.

46,5,"I have used many masks that ‚Äúguarantee‚Äù to remove blackheads or make my face ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù. All have failed me until this product right here. So easy to use. I‚Äôm not going to lie and say it didn‚Äôt hurt when peeling it off in certain areas of the face (that‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs good haha). I have sensitive skin so my face was pretty red after peeling it off but of course cleared up right away.The morning after using it, my face didn‚Äôt have any blackheads or whiteheads, and my face was so smooth!!! I even tried it on my son who is a teen starting to get acne and blackheads and it worked for him as well.

47,5,"At first I was skeptical when I received Piero Lorenzo Blackhead Remover Mask. I didn't even like to say the word! As I age, the pores are getting larger, giving dirt a place to lodge. So I said, ""what the heck? I'll try this mask . Well, I wish I would have found this product years ago!!! The first time I used it, I put it on the T-Zone (cheeks over the nose , then down the other side. It felt cool and so comfortable, I forgot about it being on, until the postman came to the door. He looked at me funny. I rinsed the mask material off. The area I put it on was smooth. and the pores in my nose, were a bit smaller.

50,4,"I‚Äôd hard to know if this is working but I do enjoy using it. I thought it would be more easy to peel off by applying a thick layer but it doesn‚Äôt help because it doesn‚Äôt dry enough (and I‚Äôve even left it on for 20 min to make sure). I use tweezers to pick up the corners when removing. I‚Äôm not a fan of the scent either- smells like cologne. I hope I‚Äôm using it correctly. I still have blackheads but I think it may be helping with my pores. I don‚Äôt use it alone, rather I‚Äôve added it to my facial caree regimen.",0,1
51,5,"Wow! This products does exactly what the description and photos show. I applied it a little thicker than needed the first time, so it took a little longer in time to set up for easy removal.

They‚Äôre watering and my face has this intense cooling, icy hot vibes.I wrote that top part as the mask is still on. I left it for 30 mins and it took me 10 mins to take off!! It didn‚Äôt peel. It was too thin in some areas and apparently too thick to rip off? Only a few chunks came off but eventually I had to scrub my face with a cleaning brush. My face hurts. Total waste of money. Don‚Äôt waste your time on this glue. Nothing even came off, it‚Äôs impossible. My eyes watered so bad it was unenjoyable.",0,0
53,4,"I have very stubborn blackheads on my nose, I have try many products and many ways to remove them, I do get some out but not all of them some are so deep and stubborn its annoying. so I have tried it and it take about 15 minutes or till dry. it definitely did remove a bunch of blackheads but not as deep cleaning as a would of wish .

Usually after one treatment the majority of my pores feel clean and refreshed. If i have a stubborn one, i just wait a few days and reuse the mask.

And so far this one is one of my top favorites. It left my face feeling so smooth and clean feeling. Even in cold areas my skin tends to get super oily, and so this mask also helped clean that. The process is a little messy but fun at the same time. It wasn‚Äôt so painful to peel. The refreshing feeling of seeing all the dirt and grime that came off with the mask is unforgettable. Really good at removing those junk on your face! We will be using it again and again!",0,1
58,1,"I have had great experiences with other masks, but this was a waste of money and not relaxing at all. After taking a shower, I put it on my face and waited until it felt dry. I thought about removing it early because it kind of burned. When it was dry, I ended up spending at least 15 minutes trying to peel it off because it came apart and ended up having to scrub my face again to get it off. The mask did nothing except rip the baby hairs out of my face.",0,0

For me, using this product has definitely helped my skin during a time where stress takes its toll.",0,1
61,5,"I‚Äôm using it on my face which is my problem area for blackheads. I absolutely enjoy this product. The product arrived on time and very well packaged. Before you use the mask, you need to open up your pores by taking hot shower/bath or just putting hot wet towel on your face for a few minutes. Then spread the mask. Leave it on for 15-20 mins. Be careful when you are peeling it off, because those little hairs on your face can be pulled out also with the mask.

63,5,This is a really nice product. The mask does what it says its going to do and I would also like to add that you should apply a thin layer of the product because that's all you really need. I went overboard and it took a bit longer to dry but the results were great. My skin was clean and blackhead free. I think the price is extremely reasonable and I should go order more because my husband tried it and now he loves it. It performs like a high end product in my opinion as I've bought a few.

64,2,"I didn't realize that the tube would only be 2oz, so its like a travel sized item. Not a full size product for $16, which I was expecting. So was a bit disturbed at that when it arrived right away. Then I started looking through some of the reviews, and it looks like this company hires people to write glowing reviews about their product. Where English is obviously not their first language, so their verbiage is wrong, etc. Then I see that this is made in Guangzhou, China. In the epicenter of this pandemic. Little bit scared that I even touched the box now.",0,0
65,5,I had a bad experience where I was trying to get a charcoal peel off mask and it was just regular gel mask wasn‚Äôt the intense one I wanted so I stopped ordering masks but online. Finally I gave it another shot with this one based on reviews and finally I got the right one! Intense as everyone says it is they are not exaggerating in those videos but it works. I needed something to completely clear my pores.,0,1
66,5,"I really liked the product. It did take longer to dry then it said but I also think I just put it on way too thick. The smell is pleasant and once it is dry it doesn't feel like its ripping your face off with it. Which is always a plus. I swear you do not need to be in excruciating pain to remove blackheads. So overall it worked well, smelled nice, and didn't hurt.",0,1
67,5,"I like this product because:1. It has no strong odor2. it comes with a paddle like stick so you can apply it to your face without using your hands. It's especially useful to me since I have long acrylic nails3. It is easy to peel off4. It really does ""suck"" or peel off dirt from your face (literal dirt, white heads, black heads) but it does not burn or sting or hurt when peeling offAn aesthetician once told me that facial skin regenerates after 10 days. I use this every 10 days and my face feels like a baby's. So this could actually be a substitute for your $100+ facial",0,1
68,4,"I‚Äôve used other black peal masks of this nature, and I‚Äôve had difficulty peaking them off. This one is easy to peel however maybe almost too easy? I have dry skin and the ones that were hard to peel off really stick to my skin so when I finally was able to pull it off, it took with it all my flaky dry skin. This one left a some of that behind but it wasn‚Äôt a huge issue.. it still worked great as a step one to my weekly face regime - I apply a hydrating mask after the peel and it works like a charm each time. Another thing I noticed with this brand is the there is a stronger scent to it - my nose definitely had to adjust to it but it didn‚Äôt cause my skin any irritation or anything. I would purchase again - I love seeing it take away all the crap from my face - very satisfying.",0,1
69,5,"I was afraid that when peeling this mask would rip off my face altogether. In reality‚Ä¶ peeling off was a breeze. I used this mask 3 times before coming here to review it. All in all, the results were better than expected. It made a big difference in my skin right away. Much smoother for sure, and softer too. I could actually just wash it off, which may have been less effective but still less painful too. By peeling it off, the mask unclogged my pores very well. I feel like my face started breathing. The mask did remove some blackheads and whiteheads but not all. The ones it did not remove it pulled to the closer to the surface and made them easier to extract. I believe it‚Äôs a great product for cleansing and detoxing my face. That was like the most refreshing feeling I‚Äôve had with a skincare product. Will definitely use again.",0,1
70,5,"I bought this based on the positive reviews and I'm not disappointed! I've used it several times focusing on my nose and chin. The first time I used it, it didn't work that well. But I had only used a thin layer. The next time, I used more product and it worked great on my nose. It still worked on my chin, just not quite as well as on my nose. I'm going to play around with more or less product on my chin to see if it will get my really stubborn blackheads. I want to clarify that by saying that even if it didn't get every last tiny blackhead on my chin, this product works and works well! My nose looks so much better. I'm grateful I listened to the reviews and gave this a shot. It's worth it!",0,1
71,5,"Peeling was interesting, and I love this because it gave me what I expected. Every time I use this mask it takes away my blackheads, whiteheads and whatever other dirt on my face, since it dried so tightly on the skin, it sunk into my pores. I usually use it right after shower, when my pores are open, it did in fact pull impurities out of the skin. With a thick layer, it takes about 30 minutes to fully dry. Be careful of those little hairs on your face because those can be pulled out also when peeling the mask. It left my face cleaner than it was, slightly dry, but feeling fresh. It‚Äôs painful to peel off but when I do it slowly and from bottom up the pain is minimized and manageable. More than anything it‚Äôs so refreshing to see impurities removed from my face. There was a little residue that was easily removed with a damp cloth. Great value! Highly recommend!",0,1
72,1,This didn‚Äôt work at all! It took forever to dry first of all and when it did and took off nothing came out! The white and black heads were still there. It‚Äôs not worth purchasing it.,0,0
73,4,"I have really sensitive skin and break out at the edges of my face (probably from my hair products and touching my face). I hoped using this would help, but it didn't. I actually had a mildly worsened break out. I can't tell that it really got much in the way of blackheads, but mine are mild. I'm going to keep trying, but just on my nose.",0,1
74,3,"Maybe it says something about my skin or maybe it says something about this product, but I don't feel like it grabs a lot of sebum (and that is what it's grabbing, not blackheads, don't be fooled). Don't see myself purchasing this anymore as I've since learned a better skincare routine will clear out my face better than any peeling mask",0,0
75,1,This is the hardest face mask to remove. Says it dries in 10-15 min really took almost 30. Still came off in little tiny pieces and took forever. And didn‚Äôt really help with black heads at all. Very runny and messy product.,0,0
76,1,I looked at product packaging there was no company name or address and only has made in China. The lack of a company name and address makes me highly suspicious of not only quality but safety.,1,0
77,5,I have used this black mask a few times. It removes white heads and leave the skin smooth and clean. The mask dries relatively fast so no waiting around. It peels off smoothly without ripping. The adhesion is strong but not painful so it does the job without the irritation. The price is competitive with similar products. I would definitely buy again.,0,1
78,4,"I liked this mask but it irritated my skin a little bit and I believe it was due to the heavy perfume used in this product....I have very sensitive skin....it smells wonderful, kinda reminds me of Mademoiselle by Chanel, I could smell it as soon as I opened the shipping box it came in....however, this much perfume in something I put on my face is a no for me...that's why I gave it only 4 stars...I will be giving away.",0,1
79,5,"This product works very well. I ordered this while searching for a new mask because another black mask we tried irritated my wife‚Äôs skin. This one is a winner, it does not irritate her skin and works very well. The only downside is that it‚Äôs a little tough to smear around and it has to be nice and thick or it dries blotchy. I would definitely recommend this product.",0,1
80,1,Did not pull out blackheads as i thought it would. Too expensive.,0,0
81,5,"I didn't get a ton of stuff on it like in the commercials, but that's OK. I'm pretty sure it does the trick. My pores look cleaner, so I assume they will become smaller over time which is what I need. The scent is a bit too much for me, but it's not horrible. I had to let it dry for 25 minutes to peel off easily.",0,1
82,5,"I had really bad blackheads and was looking for a good mask to remove them. I tried this and it works really well! I use it twice a week after showering and my face is really smooth and cleansed afterward. The only thing that I would say is that it's really important to use a thin layer (it doesn't say to on the box, only in the description on here). Otherwise it takes forever to dry",0,1
83,3,I usually buy the strips that dry on your face an have had great success with them. I decided to give this a try due to its rating and amount of customer use. However I have ran into issues. I do not know how to apply the correct amount on my face. It's either too thin or it's running down my face. When removing Im either struggling to peal it off or it's still muddy. I would like better instructions on how to apply this product.,0,0
84,5,This product is great for removing those stubborn blackheads from your nose and for removing dead skin on your face. I highly recommend do not use it on eyebrows mustache or lips as it will hurt like hell. I've seen too many videos on YouTube people doing it and I don't want you to either. If you're smart then this is amazing!,0,1
85,5,"I have super oily skin and I've tried numerous different charcoal peel off masks, most don't even remove the dead layer of skin. This one however, was able to get into to pores a bit more and pulls out dry dead skin cells and even some surface white and black heads. Still doesn't get all of them, even after a vigorous scrub before I apply the mask, but that's only because my skin is so oily, it's hard for anything to stick to it. Will buy this product again once I run out. Also it leaves my skin super soft and matte.",0,1
86,5,"Really loved using this. Definitely take a hot shower or put a warm towel on your face for better results. I applied it pretty thick to my face and was afraid it was going to be tough to rip off and hurt. But when it dries it gets the job done + it doesn't hurt and peels over VERY easily. Love it, definitely going to buy more!",0,1
87,3,"Product is good, but make sure you give it plenty of time to dry. I applied a bit thick and took a bit more than the recommended 15 minutes. Although if it doesn't pull off completely the scrub to get it off will definitely exfoliate the skin. If it drys completely this isn't a problem. Overall happy with it.",0,0
88,1,I usually use biore pore strips weekly and get out a forest worth of black heads and such. This pulled out maybe 5. I put it on just thick enough to not be see through and it took about an hour to fully dry. It did not work as advertised for me even though I put it on right after a shower so it had the best chance.,0,0
89,5,"UPDATE 5/7/13: I just bought two more packages of these. The main reason I go through so many is that when my friends see me using them, they ask where I got them, and since there were so many in the first package I bought, I was giving them away any time someone admired them. The other reason is that I have them all over the house, in the car, and in my purse (and always one of the attachable ones on my phone). I have an android phone, and these are great to use when I swipe, which I prefer to texting. I still use it for my iPad, as well. They come in fun colors, and they are so affordable. I still can't understand why people pay so much for just one. I have one that cost $10, and it doesn't work any better than these.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I love these! Love the colors, and there are plenty of them, so I always have one handy, even if I didn't put the last one back with my iPad. I guess I am not a perfectionist with these things, because I don't see why someone would spend the money for the more expensive ones. However, I don't spend a lot on pens, either--too easy to lose them.",0,1
90,5,"This blackhead mask is very easy to put on. It's not super sticky that it leaves residue on you after putting in on. It spreads on very easy and it does not smell awful. This product can be used about 10-15 times, I would say. When you peel it off, it can be tempting to just rip it off, BUT PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS. Remove the mask so that it can remove the impurities. The mask also doesn't rip when peeling it off. The areas that I put the mask on feel very soft and clean after using it. Overall, very happy with this product.",0,1
91,5,You need to make it a bit thicker on the edges if you make it too thin it takes a few extra minutes to get off. But this is a solid product and I'd buy it again.,0,1
92,1,"This product does NOT remove blackheads. After using it, I had to pop my blackheads with my fingers like an idiot. Then, the company had the nerve to send me spam in the mail to my house where I live and ask me to buy more. ""Hello ma'am would you like to buy some more of our trash?"" ""Sure, I'll take the lot!"" hah yeah",0,0
93,5,"Mask comes with a little plastic spoon, which makes applying it on the face very easy and keeps fingers clean. After use I wiped all the remaining product from the spoon and then washed it, I'm very happy how mess free it is!I washed my face and put a hot towel for a minute before putting the mask on. It felt great on the face. But I think I applied too much, because after 15 min it was still wet, and I had to wait a little bit longer. After mask was completely dry I peeled it off (it was a little bit painful on the cheeks, maybe I kept mask too long on my face..). The result was ok, definitely i will try this mask again in few days.",0,1
94,5,"At first I taught they were cheap and thus low quality, but was surprise to see that they work great on the iPad3, iphone and itouch. I bought this for my kids to use with the iPad, specially for apps that are designed for writing. They use them several times a week when they study for their spelling test with an app called ""Things to Learn"", and they were trilled because it was like using a pencil when writing.The long ones are very comfortable and the tip is sturdy, they lasted being thrown in their backpack and in the pencil box, mixed with all the pencils. The small ones come with a string to attach to the earphone plug, this are the ones that my kids prefer I find them too small for an adult to write but they are great for using on my iPhone for dialing or navigating thru apps. The big ones are the ones I like, both for adults and for kids. Have used them with several apps and respond very good. Have used them for gifts for kids, together with an app for their use and both the parents and kids like them.",0,1
95,5,"Arrived via USPS in a bubble wrap envelope within a few days of ordering.The cheapest I can find these locally are at Walgreens for about $6 a piece. Those are plastic and no where near as nice as these. At Office Depot, they are about $14 a piece for the cheapest. So, this is a good deal considering quality and quantity.These are nicely made. There is a hole in the clip end to attach a lanyard. There are also inserts for attaching to a standard earplug hole. I believe the barrel is plastic but it has a metallic appearance. They do not look cheap. The small ones are easily attached to a key chain and are 1.75 inches. That is 0.25 inches shorter than my house key. The bigger ones are 4.5 inches in length.I do not care for the girly colors so I will give those away but there are more than enough for me. I wish you could order single colors.They work well on my Kindle Fire and Samsung Galaxy 3. I also use them for debit card devices, self checkout screens, etc. Lots of fingers touch those screens.Overall, very pleased with purchase.",0,1
96,5,"I had ordered a 10-piece Stylus Set prior to this, and was disappointed...they were cheap, one broke the first day, the color scratched off, and it was 2 of each of five colors. I was prepared for a repeat performance with this set, but was VERY PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!! The Friendly Swede Stylus Set feels heavier in your hand, the colors are vibrant, and the variety is fantastic! I brought them to a gathering with a few friends and everyone got the color (and style, small with the plug that goes into the headphone slot, or the larger type with the clip) that they wanted. I tell everyone about these, I've shared with friends and my sons, and I still have several to spare. You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with this purchase!! As a bonus, you get a cleaning cloth (yes, it actually works!), and lanyards! The whole set comes well packaged in a resealable case. When I change my iPad mini (or iPhone 5) cases, I pick a stylus that matches the new case, and put the old one in the handy case (sliding the stylus right back into the wrapper that the new one came out of first!). Don't miss this deal!",0,1
97,5,"When looking for styli, it is overwhelming to see the number of choices one has! It is also amazing to see the difference in price as well.When I saw this bundle, I was a bit ""suspicious"" that you get this many styli for that price and have them be any good.Well... I was wrong! They feel good in the hand, although if your hand is sweaty, the smooth surface will make your fingers slip, but that's true of regular, smooth pens as well.It's great they give you two different sizes as well. My wife loves the smaller one that plugs into her earphone jack. It really makes it easier for her to interact with her Samsung SII.I use the larger ones as I have bigger hands. I use it on my Galaxy SIII, Nook Color with CM7, and my iPad (which I hate!)In addition to making interactions easier, it also has the added bonus of keeping your screen cleaner!Go ahead and buy these. I think you'll be very satisfied with your purchase and with this quantity and price, you'll be able to give some to friends, family and business associates!",0,1
98,1,"This product doesn't work at all. It doesn't suction anything, has a horrible chemical smell, and is nearly impossible to remove. Also, they'll try to bribe you for a 5 star review and their review process doesn't even work properly. Their steps did not recognize my order number.",0,0
99,5,"I had started breaking out from stress and bought a pore remover - which ended up just bruising my face...I wanted to try a mask but was skeptical because I've seen a lot that haven't worked for me and was scared of causing any more breakouts, so, I went for product reviews and figured ""what the heck."" I tried it on a couple of days after I got the product - it scared the crap out of my 5 YO btw haha - but I felt the results almost immediately. It's very easy to put on, leave it on for about 15 minutes (which can get tricky because it does get a little itchy), then peel/wash it right off. It leaves your skin feeling amazing afterwards too!",0,1
101,5,First time I used this type of mask and it was wonderful. The scent is very nice and not overpowering. It also didn't irritate my skin . It felt like a cool washcloth on my face. Easy to remove also. It left my skin feeling clean and soft. Will definitely purchase again.,0,1
102,5,It is amazing. I just put a little thin layer and let it dry. Its hard to peel off but it all peels off in one rubbery mask that tears all your impurities out and your pores are shrunk considerably. The more i used it the more my pores became tiny. It really amazing,0,1
103,5,I really enjoy this project! I‚Äôve been reading up on a lot of do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts in skincare and I have no qualms with this product! It‚Äôs not irritating at all (what I mean by that is that it‚Äôs not super sticky on the skin). I don‚Äôt have any pain removing it as I do with other masks. It‚Äôs not harsh and doesn‚Äôt leave me red at all. It‚Äôs a very gentle peel off mask!! I don‚Äôt worry about damaging my skin using this!,0,1
104,5,"The mask is very easy to apply with the included spatula which I love; no more sticky fingers! It dries in the time stated on the box and does a nice job of clearing pores. I do feel like I need to use it more than once to get the deep dirt out, but it‚Äôs definitely better than all other masks I‚Äôve used.",0,1
105,4,"Only used 1 time so far on the nose. I followed the instructions, cleaned, dried the area then apply the mask. It dries after 10 - 15 minutes. It removes easy but I don‚Äôt see all the blackheads coming out as pictured. I will try again two days later with a thicker application. I did followed the mask with toner. I am hoping to see more coming out. Fingers crossed.",0,1
106,2,"Smelled good, however I didn‚Äôt think it really pulled a lot of my blackheads out. I washed prior to the mask as instructed, however I had to leave it on longer than the suggested 15 minutes because it wasn‚Äôt dry. It wasn‚Äôt too terrible pulling off my nose or chin, but again I didn‚Äôt see much difference. For the price I would not recommend purchasing",0,0
107,5,"It is thick and a little goes a long way. It works perfectly as a cleanser and as a facial masque/peel. It works so well, I could see a difference right away. My skin feels smoother and soft afterwards. I use it all over my body, not just my face.",0,1
108,1,It left my face dirtier than to begin with because of the residue. This did not get blackheads off. It left a lot of residue. I ended up chunking it in the trash.,0,0
109,5,It didn‚Äôt hurt at all to take off which was nice. It didn‚Äôt get get everything out of your pores but it got about 90% so pretty good. The down side for me was that it smelt like men‚Äôs cologne which I didn‚Äôt like but overall I would get another.,0,1
110,5,"I have very sensitive skin. At first it burned so badly I was pretty nervous. But after about 5 minutes it just felt ""cooling"". It did an amazing job and my pores have never been more clear and smooth. Didnt leave my skin red or irritated.",0,1
111,4,The instructions were easy to follow. It is a great product to remove blackheads around the nose. In order to use it I recommend washing your face first with warm water to open up to pores and then add a good amount of the product to give a good layer to be easy to peel off.,0,1
112,5,"My skin was so soft and smooth after using this. I think for me it was most effective on my t-zone and I will focus only on that area next time. It was difficult to pull off my cheeks, but everywhere else was fine. I will be buying more!",0,1
113,3,"I got the product based on the deep cleaning claims. I have blackheads on my chin and was looking for a way to get rid of them. This mask was good for surface cleansing but wasn't great at the deep cleaning I was looking for. It did soften my skin due to taking a lot of surface dead skin off. The scent was okay, not overpowering. It was easy-ish to remove. You have to make sure everything is dry - areas where the mask is thicker was deceptively dry but difficult to remove. The edges left a black residue I had to scrub off. All in all, it is an alright product.",0,0
114,5,Honestly this has been the easiest to peel off. I haven‚Äôt tried many but I would much rather buy this easy to use product than pay $15 so my barber can do the same thing! You will not regret buying it. Natural smell and cool to the touch. Would definitely recommend!,0,1
115,1,"This mask didn‚Äôt do much other than rip all the little babies hairs out of my face. I tried it twice, once with a sink wash and mask application and once after a long, hot shower in hopes that my pores would be more open. Neither time yielded results. However, my skin does feel soft and looks shiny. For me, it was not worth the purchase.",0,0
116,5,"I've never used one of these products before, but after getting annoyed with blackheads on my nose, I gave in and purchased a tube... the product is easy to apply, and though it is a bit messy if you aren't careful, it dries quickly and is strangely satisfying to remove and see all the junk coming out of your pores. 10/10 would buy again.",0,1
117,5,"I have used a few other brands of facial masks such as this one, but this one is by far a joy to use. I had a wonderful experience because it felt very light and soothing as I was applying it on my face. When it was time to take it off I was surprised and pleased at how effective and painless it was to remove. Other brands make it a bit painful to remove because it tugs at the skin and it has to be removed very slowly and it might still be a bit uncomfortable. But this one is great for sensitive skin. I recommend this facial mask if you want a beautifying and easy to used facial mask.",0,1
118,5,"You should leave it on a little longer than the package states ( about 5 minutes longer). This mask didn't hurt when I peeled it off, it removed all of my clogged pores and didn't have a weird small. Would recommend to everyone!",0,1
119,5,The price are affordableHow do I start ?The scent are more relaxing than other black mask products.It has a little bit of a rose scent or is it just me?After I use suction black mask the pores on my noes got removeIt adsorb the pores and adjust my skinI use it ones it week with my skin care routine,0,1
120,5,I was hesitant at first that this product would create changes I‚Äôd be satisfied with BUT they surely surpassed my expectations. I wish the container was bigger as I feel like I will use up the bottle quite quickly. I have been using it over a week now and I have some pretty bad black pores over my nose but after 2-2 uses I could see changes! Even my mother noticed that my pores looked less clog. As mentioned the only downside is the size. I would of hoped for a bigger size for the price I paid but surely the work this produce does is amazing.,0,1
121,4,"I lived in Taiwan for 6 years and we regularly had access to some of the best health and beauty products from surrounding Asian countries like Japan and Korea at very reasonable prices. So I wanted to give this product a try.I like the actual texture and use of the black mask. However, the smell is a bit odd and stronger than I‚Äôm used to. I‚Äôm not clear on what the smell comes from exactly. Thankfully, it didn‚Äôt bother me too much but it was noticeable.Otherwise, a nice black mask for the price!",0,1
122,5,"I think I put a little too much on try first time, so I took a little longer to dry. It got a pretty good amount of stuff off, even though I didn‚Äôt do it properly. The next time much better. Smells good, I like the relaxing cold feeling.",0,1
123,5,"Best charcoal peel-off mask, so easy to use, feel great while on, and super easy to peel off, all the blackheads from my nose came out, the ones on my chin were a bit stubborn, so I needed a second application, overall great product at a great price.",0,1
124,5,Both my teenage son and myself a post menopausal mom love your product. My son found it to be a little bit painful when he removed it however I‚Äôm tougher so it doesn‚Äôt bother me. Only thing I would suggest is to reduce the fragrance which smells like men‚Äôs cologne.,0,1
125,5,"Very happy with product. I only use it on the tip of my nose and ball of my chin and spot treatment for pimples because I worry about peeling off my whole face and causing myself to age faster.Totally works, smells great, will last me a long time.",0,1
126,5,"I love this product it makes your skin squeaky clean, however being fully realistic it will not get everything out if you have very deep pored skin. It will clean the topographical later though and keep it feeling fresh and clean for days after so i think that‚Äôs a win in itself :)",0,1
127,5,Bought this for spa time with my teenage daughter. We love it! We make sure to steam our faces then apply. Works as it states. We have tried countless black mask but this one is our new favorite!,0,1
128,4,"I really liked the scent and the cooling effect when you first put it on. It left my face feeling very clean and smooth. My only complaint was how much it hurt when I peeled it off, lol. I am in no way a baby when it comes to pain, but damn...it felt like slowly ripping a band aid off. Given how well it works, I will continue to use it though.",0,1
129,2,"I was a bit disappointed in this to be honest. I used to use a product just like this one, but I couldn't remember the brand name so I decided to go with this one instead. I loved the previous product I used and it exceeded my expectations, so I expected this to do the same but it unfortunately did not. It didn't really seem to suck up any of my blackheads or gunk inside my pores. I ended up throwing out and buying the classic Biore strips from Target which did the trick.",0,0
130,2,"This mask didn‚Äôt stick well. I had a misconception that these types of mask would stick to your skin five times stickier than the nose strips. However, it was less effective in sticking to your skin and was too easy to peele off. It‚Äôs not effective as the strips. As I was reading the reviews, some said it stick to your face very well, which it does, but it‚Äôs not effective in removing pores. I‚Äôm still searching for a mask that sticks to your face like duck tape! If anyone found it, let me know!",0,0
131,5,"My daughter has really stubborn blackheads and this didn't pull them out, but she still liked it and is using it regularly. I tried it too and really liked the way it removes the dead skin cells. It is painful to pull off, but not terrible. I'll use it again and replace it when my daughter uses it all up!",0,1
132,5,"This mask is good if your goal is for overall cleaning of fine facial hair and surface level blackheads. It does not grab onto deeper blackheads. It is slightly painful to take off on the more tender areas of the face, but that is mostly due to the peach fuzz that it grabs onto. The tube it comes in is also not very large, so I'm not sure how long it will last. The consistency of the mask is fairly thick, it is not watery. The smell is pleasant, and the applicator it comes with is helpful. Your face does feel smoother afterwards.",0,1
133,5,My spouse was looking for this on amazon.com. I looked over her shoulder and ordered it as a surprise gift. She liked it a lot after 2 applications. Will be ordering more of it for her.,0,1
134,4,"I don‚Äôt try many masks but I wasn‚Äôt impressed by this one. It was easy to take off which I appreciated, however it didn‚Äôt get many of my blackheads like I wanted. They have great customer service!",0,1
135,4,I‚Äôve tried a lot of masks and I‚Äôll have to rate this one a solid 3.5. I absolutely love the spatula that comes with mask; it is a good size and allows easy coverage. The tube is full for the price of the product and I think that is a good value. It‚Äôs easy to pull off but you do have to leave it on for the full 15 minutes. A toner definitely finishes this product off after use and leaves my skin feeling fresh and light with is perfect for a chilly fall day!,0,1
136,5,My pores shrunk when i looked in the mirror the next day and i was amazed. Although it isn't the easiest to peel off its worth it. i think its at a good price when you think of the results and how they're almost instant.,0,1
137,4,"I ordered this product based on recommendations from Amazon suggestion, but was skeptical of black masks in general due to research I had done prior to ordering. I was pleasantly surprised. My face felt very soft after and I could see the extractions that came out with the mask. It did not hurt at all, which I had heard can happen with some black masks. The only area of improvement for the manufacturer I would suggest is lightening up the scent. It smells good, but it‚Äôs a little strong for me.",0,1
138,5,"I have been using this product for a while now. It sticks well on face, comes off easy in one piece rather than in bits. Gives fresh feel and good cleansing on applied areas. Stings a little while drying but nothing harmful I felt.",0,1
139,5,This is a great mask! It is just as described and is the best black mask I've used so far. Some of the others have been hard to remove. Not this one! I love it and will be buying more in the future.,0,1
140,5,I really enjoyed using this product. If you‚Äôre a freak like me and enjoy pore extractions you‚Äôll like this product. I use it once or twice a week or if I see my pores becoming excessively clogged. It doesn‚Äôt stink like some of the other options I‚Äôve tried and it has not irritated my skin after using it for a couple months now. I say give it a whirl.,0,1
141,5,Easy to apply. I like the small applicator tool included in the box. I don't have to get my hands dirty. Goes on easy and after 20 minutes peels off easily. Clean your face before and dry it. Then apply the mask. Spread it out evenly. Leaves face feeling and looking clean.,0,1
142,5,This product is cool when it goes on and honestly my face feels so clean and smooth afterwards. The smell isnt bad and for the cost I love using it. It deeply cleans my pores and removes blackheads. I love it!! Will buy more before I run out.,0,1
143,5,This product is awesome. It leaves your face feeling so soft and smooth. It‚Äôs not the easiest to take off. It‚Äôs a little painful. But the ending results are well worth the pain. We as women go through a lot to make ourselves beautiful. I am definitely going to buy this again.,0,1
144,5,I like that it does feel like it's pulling impurities out. You do need to make sure you help your pores open up before hand otherwise it doesn't work to its fullest capacity.,0,1
145,5,My teenage boy had blackheads on his nose! After using this awesome product they are gone! He is so happy with the results! Easy to use and easy to remove! Spread on the area and let it completely dry before peeling off! You can actually see the dirt and grime after peeling it off! We have tried other products to remove the blackheads and nothing compares!,0,1
146,5,This product really cleaned my pores well and peeling it was very satisfying. Make sure not to put on too thick or it takes a long time to dry and doesn‚Äôt really work properly.,0,1
147,5,"I was skeptical that this would work, and I was honestly shocked at how clean my pores were after the first use. I didn‚Äôt even realize I needed this mask as badly as I did until I took it off and saw the ‚Äúafter‚Äù! Easy to remove.",0,1
148,4,"Didn't suction to the skin as much as I thought it would. Still left blackheads. Used on whole family. Good thing about it, it smells fresh and leaves skin extremely SMOOTH!!",0,1
149,5,"I've been trying to find an affordable charcoal mask for a while now. This one is definitely the most affordable, and it left my face feeling tight, clean, and refreshed. It also has a very pleasant scent. My favorite part about it is that it does not come off TOO easily. I've tried some masks that come off so easy that it doesn't feel like it removed any dirt/blackheads at all. This one was the perfect satisfying mix of hard to pull, but without hurting at all! I will definitely be buying more.",0,1
150,5,"I have used this product for more than 6 months and it is wonderful! My skin feels soft and smooth after using it. Just a note: yes, if you rip it off, it will cause some pain, so be careful! Best used after a hot shower when your pores are most open and let it fully dry before peeling it off.",0,1
151,5,"I used this product to clean out my pores and tighten my skin. I took a shower prior to use. The scent was ok, not strong. I have sensitive dry skin and this product did not aggravate my symptoms. I am satisfied with the result and will buy again.",0,1
152,5,Very good product. Love how it makes my skin feel afterwards. It definitely helps get any dried skin off. It does help with blackheads but I think some of mine might be a little too stubborn. I'm plan on trying after a shower to see of that helps.,0,1
153,5,"There are some pros and cons to this product. First off, it doesn't ""pull out"" much , or my skin is alot better than I thought it was. Previously , I have only tried the biore pore strips and they seemed more powerful but maybe that was because it was a strip and meant for a more targeted area. It smells nice, feels clean after, and is easy to get off anything left behind after peeling. All in all, I would say give it a try.",0,1
154,3,Exfoliates well but still not as effective on blackheads as a biore strip to be honest. I have really big pores and get a lot of blackheads and this seems to miss the majority of them. My skin feels really clean afterwards but I do have to rewatch because after I peel it off it‚Äôs pretty dry,0,0
155,5,We were skeptical about this product but it really does work. My daughters and I have been using it for a few weeks now. It has the tingling sensation of charcoal masks that we love and is easy to peel off. It removes the stuff in the pores which is weirdly satisfying to inspect after you peel off the mask. We haven‚Äôt had any issues with skin irritation etc. Similar to the strips but good for areas of the face with folds that strips sometimes don‚Äôt accomodate.,0,1
156,5,"My husband and I got this mask for a spa date night that we had. We both loves the minty, cooling feature that the mask had. We found that if you put the mask on too thick that it took much longer to dry then the directions said. Also, if you got some of the mask in your hairline you could easily remove it by soaking your face in a wet rag for a bit. The mask left our faces feeling smooth and clean. We both really enjoyed this product.",0,1
157,5,"I've been searching for a good blackhead face mask for so long and nothing worked until I found this one. It not only pulled out all of my black heads, but it also left my face looking clean, soft, and glowy. It does not have any strong unpleasing scent and the tube will definitely last me for a long time. This blackhead mask is definitely worth the money and it is the most effective one for all skin types. Love it!",0,1
158,5,"Upon receiving the package, the packaging of the product was very well put together. Once unboxing and applying the product, the application process was straightforward and fool-proof. After a few trial and error applications; I did find that a thick application of the product was needed in order to see results.Overall, I give the product a 7.5 out of 10, only due to the vague application instructions (amount of product).",0,1
159,5,I use peel off masks to remove facial hair. I don't have too much blackheads but i can say that this mask will remove everything what appears on the skin. Only don't keep it on the face for more than 15 min ..it's harder to remove,0,1
160,5,"cleanse and scrub before applying this mask for best effect, I pulled the mask bottoms up, and I could see blackheads and whiteheads, would buy it again!",0,1
161,5,The product really does remove residue off your skin. It won‚Äôt get the really deep blackheads but more surface level dirt. It is a nice face mask and I will keep using it.,0,1
162,5,"After using this product, my complexion appears much clearer. It wasn't painful to peel off either! This stuff does everything it claims to do and leaves you feeling refreshed and clean. I'm always looking for new skin care products, and this one is a great addition to my arsenal! I've tried a lot of different products, but I think I like this one the best because it gives you a good clean start before applying a moisturizer. Try it, you won't be disappointed!",0,1
163,5,"Have bought this brand several times now. Having large pores on my nose, these really pull the ""gunk"" out! And my face feels so smooth after. Highly recommend!",0,1
164,5,I have purchased a similar mask and the consistency was hard to work with and made a whole mess. This was just perfect. It is so easy to go on and I like the little spoon it comes with. Definitely recommend.,0,1
165,4,"I love that this face mask is a peel off, it makes it so much easier to remove! It unclog my pores very well, But it removes dead skin and works well",0,1
166,5,"It's a little frightening to use at first because it is SO black, but it tingles pleasantly as it dries, and peels off easily! my skin is very smooth after I peel it off.",0,1
167,5,"This product is gentle on the skin, and seemed to remove some things from my skin. It did not completely remove all dirt from pores, but maybe after a few more tries I'll start to notice more of a difference. I would use it again.",0,1
168,5,Oh my goodness!!! My skin feels so smooth and looks amazing after using this mask. It's become my Thursday routine and I see this being something long term!,0,1
169,5,I love these masks. Easier to Apply with silicone spatula makeup tool. Apply in two thin layers to easily remove and ensure good coverage.,0,1
170,5,"I love this mask! It feels so awesome when you take it off! It's not terrible to take off, it does hurt a little bit but that means it's doing it's job! I would recommend this to others who are looking for a charcoal mask.",0,1
171,5,Just know this product must be applied thickly & allowed to dry thoroughly! Safe for sensitive skin! Remove carefully & take a look at debris removed to see if it works for you!,0,1
172,5,"This product is great. Easy to peel off, cleans up pores and leaves skin feeling great. Takes long than suggested to dry, but totally worth it.",0,1
173,5,"Works great just wish the tube was bigger, looks bigger on the description, I didn‚Äôt realize it was only 2oz, seems too pricey for the tube size",0,1
174,4,This skin mask works pretty well. Drying time varies depending on how much you apply on your face. It‚Äôs peels off easily once dried. Our faces felt smooth after removal and even smoother the next morning.,0,1
175,1,"Item received a day late, totally fine cause I was super excited to give this a try. Unfortunately it‚Äôs completely busted. I tried opening it from the top and noticed the mask had leaked out and when I pulled it out it, the bottle was busted. Super disappointing. Can‚Äôt even use it, most of the product has already spilled out. The box it came in was completely fine and the other items I ordered were not damaged at all so I know it wasn‚Äôt shipping.",0,0
176,5,"I was actually and pleasantly surprised by this products ability to work and you can see and feel results just after completing one use of the face mask. Many products these days claim results, but you do not see or feel a single thing for any period of time or weeks on end. However, not the case with this product! I will forever be a customer of this great face mask! Awesome product development people!",0,1
177,5,"Does a great job of removing blackheads and other ‚Äúgunk,‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt leave any residue or scent. Can be a little tricky to apply evenly (definitely need some kind of brush or applicator), and can be difficult to remove (trick is to make sure to let it dry COMPLETELY).",0,1
178,5,Purchased for my son who has blackheads on his nose. Does a great job of lifting out all the impurities in the skin...just remember to follow directions for best benefit.,0,1
179,5,"Got a crap done of gunk out of my face, didn‚Äôt hurt like everyone says it does to remove. And didn‚Äôt irritate my skin which is amazing!",0,1
180,5,"Refreshing tingly feeling when applied. I usually have breakouts at the beginning of my cycle every month, but I was pleasantly surprised that this mask helped reduce that. Easy to apply and easy to peel off, only some residue left behind which is easily removed with water. Doesn't hurt or rip out my hair if I accidentally cover some.",0,1
181,5,"There was a visible difference in the way my skin looked, made it really smooth and seemed to help with the small blackheads on my chin.",0,1
182,5,"It took me a little while to find the right amount of product to put on my face (less is more) but after I figured it out, the mask peeled off super easily and made my face feel so clean after. I have been doing about one mask per week for the past 3 weeks and it has made my skin noticeably more clearer.",0,1
183,5,"Great mask! My boyfriend and I tried this mask for the first time. It felt cool and refreshing at application. The product scent was a little strong at first but wasn‚Äôt overpowering or unpleasant. Once the mask dried, it was a little hard to peel off. It hurt a little for me in spots on my face with peach fuzz. My man found it easier to remove. Our skin was clear, silky and radiant! I would recommend this mask.",0,1
184,5,This mask was amazing!!! Easy to apply and totally legit. I did have to let mine dry longer that the directions in order to get it off without being gooey. It was a little hard to get off just because it stung but I think it did what it was suppose to do!,0,1
185,5,"So far it‚Äôs great, this thing takes out my blackheads/whiteheads/hair. It leaves my skin feeling baby soft. The only thing is I wish it came in a bigger size so I could buy it since this one is pretty small. Other than that I love it",0,1
186,5,"This product is excellent. It goes on thick and sticky, and dries quickly. Unlike many peel off masks, that break and are difficult to handle, this Mask peels off in one sheet, pulling all the gunk from your skin. My skin is smooth and looks great.",0,1
187,5,"This product drys in about 15m. Once dried, the material is light weight, almost like single use plastic bag. It is fairly easy to remove as long as you've applied a thick layer. It works as advertised.",0,1
188,5,"It smells wonderful, easy to get off. I just find it a little less effective as others, I like it a little bit stronger, feel I have to use it more often.",0,1
189,5,"I am happy with this product, the drying time is very quick which is nice, and the peel-off works very well. It is fluid and is not hard to pull off. It seems to remove blackheads well or at least loosen them up for removal (if they have been deep in skin a long time). Great product to use weekly!",0,1
190,5,"Mask goes on well and has nice cooling sensation as it dries. It's a bit tough to get an even coating thickness with the provided applicator but after a few masks you'll get the hang of it. For me I've found the dry time to be a bit longer than the box instructions.Overall, mask is a good value and does well to dry out and pull oil off my face.",0,1
191,5,Man this was really good to try out. The only thing I didnt like was taking it off lol. It hurts taking it off but my face did feel much better and clean.,0,1
192,5,Me and my girlfriend used it. Put a little too much on at first it will take longer to dry if you do that. But it definitely took out my blackheads that were stuck in there. Will definitely keep using.,0,1
193,5,"I've tried a lot of face masks and I've never actually seen any results so I was a little skeptical going in. It's easy to apply, smells great, and if you wait till the mask fully dries, it pulls allllll the things you didn't wanna see out of your pores. Great product, will definitely be buying again once it runs out.",0,1
194,5,Looks cool and goes in smoothly. Don‚Äôt do a thick layer or it‚Äôll take forever to dry but a nice thin layer works perfect,0,1
195,5,"This was a fun product to try and I was skeptical due to the price, but I am happy with the purchase! I really feel like it pulled out some of the impurities in my skin and tightened my pores. I also followed it up with some toner and my face feels super soft. The only warning I have is to not get it close to your hair line when applying - it can pull some hair out when you take the mask off. That's how strong it is!",0,1
196,5,"Overall a good peel off mask, comes off fairly easily, almost all in one piece! Didn't get as deep with some of my blackheads as I would have liked but a good valie for your money!",0,1
197,5,I have been using this product since a very long time and I‚Äôm very happy with the results ! My skin looks fairly young and blackheads/whiteheads free which can be a major concern to any user in today‚Äôs lifestyle!I truly recommend this product for professional as well as new users!Cheers to Quality!!!üëç,0,1
198,5,"I love it! I‚Äôve bought it before for myself and let my mom use it, and she ended up taking the whole bottle so I got her more for Christmas! It really works and leaves your face feeling clear and refreshed. Make sure to moisturize after using because it does dry your face out over a couple of days.",0,1
199,5,What i liked about this mask is that it isn‚Äôt too runny like other brands. It dries up rather quick and you can see all the gunk that it pulls off your face. My face always looks clear and freshly radiant after EVERY use.,0,1
200,5,"Highly satisfied with this product. I use a brush to put on my face. After it dries, it comes off easily with little pain. Tip - hold your skin while pulling off the product makes it less easier to remove. Leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.",0,1
201,5,Bought this Face mask thinking it would be just like the others although I was wrong! I love how it smells and feels on the skin while applying it and removing it. It doesn‚Äôt yank the skin but it does remove all the black & white heads. Definitely buying another one after I‚Äôm done with this one.,0,1
202,5,"This product works very well and did exactly what it said it would! The mask removed many of the blackheads from my nose and it was easy to apply and peel! In order to avoid a painful removal experience, make sure to remove the mask within 10‚Äì15 minutes! Any longer and it might become more difficult and painful to remove. Additionally, skin was smooth and soft after removal. I highly recommend this product!",0,1
203,5,"This was my first time trying a suction mask, and I was pleased with how great it worked. I've heard that masks like these might hurt to peel off, but this didn't hurt at all and came off extremely easy. This did an adequate job deep cleaning my pores; next time I will take a steam shower before using so my pores are more open and can allow this product to do an even better job. Overall would recommend!",0,1
204,5,This product is amazing! It actually works suctions and cleans out clogged pores and leaves my skin refreshed and soft!,0,1
205,4,Great mask got all of my hard to get to black heads. Dont get even a drop on any hair or eyebrows if you do they will be gone when you pull this mask off. Hurts a bit to peel but nothing I couldn't handle. Beauty is pain.,0,1
206,5,"I was a little skeptical from some of the reviews whether or not it would remove my blackheads but OMG it Actually worked! ppeeled All those badboys right out from my nose and cheek area where i had the most! Will def. use this once every 1-2 weeks. No pain, easy to remove",0,1
207,5,This is a really good product. It smells really good and it actually pulls off a lot of dead skin and black heads! I won‚Äôt be buying any other black peel off mask.,0,1
208,5,I have really bad skin and my face is always covered with blackheads. I used several of these masks and this is by far the best. I find it that it works best after a really short shower to open your pores.,0,1
209,5,"First timing using product, less is definitely more! I think I used too much on my nose so it took forever to dry and almost rubbed off instead of able to peel it off. On my face did a thinner layer and it worked much better! Smell is pleasant. Overall, would recommend thins product. Did get stuck to the sink and had to scrub off but think that is because it wasn‚Äôt all the way dry when I peeled off.",0,1
210,5,Kind of gross but I love pealing off this stuff and seeing the gunk that was on my face! Very easy to apply and even easier to take off. Definitely works better after a hot shower and my pores are opened. It takes a little bit of trial and error to get the right amount on your face but more product works better for me. I wasn't blow away by the scent but it's not horrible. A repeat purchase for me!,0,1
211,5,"Worked so well! Removed all the dead skin, came off all in one piece, and got some blackheads too!",0,1
212,3,"Yes this product does exactly what it advertises. But in my personal opinion, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs worth the price they charge. I only got 3 or 4 face masks from this entire tube.",0,0
213,5,I have tried everything to help with my complexion. I have had blackheads from a teenager and into my adult and I have had no luck with any products. This product is making a huge difference. I use a facial steamer prior to putting the mask on. Highly recommend.,0,1
214,5,Absolutely awesome left my face feeling smooth and clean took out tons of clogged pores.,0,1
215,4,"I like the way it feels and I like the way it spreads. You can definitely tell it is a good quality product. It does not hurt when you peel it off, however it does not feel like it grabs as many clogged pores as other products I have used.",0,1
216,5,"I really like that you can put the mask on dry! This was a huge plus to me, it works pretty well for the price, it got all the tiny hairs, white heads and black heads. It‚Äôs not the best charcoal mask I‚Äôve used which is why I knocked off a star but for the price it‚Äôs pretty good!",0,1
217,5,"I like the feeling that is leaves, and it does remove some blackheads. Its does a better job of waxing off your baby hairs though. Unfortunately, the downside is that it hurts quiet a bit. So i suggest using it in patches so you can get it off easily. I'll still use it for sure though because I find it does help remove hairs that could be prone to turning into a pimple.",0,1
218,5,"Overall a good product, makes my face feel refreshed after I peel off and makes my skin smoother. I just wish that it would help me with my black head problem, it doesn‚Äôt have enough pull to get the blackheads off my nose after multiple uses but better than most peel off mask I previously used. Would recommend!",0,1
219,5,This really cleans my skin and even pulls out peachfuzz yet gentle at the same time. I will definitely purchase it again!,0,1
220,3,"Didn't feel like it cleaned out my pores that well. Hurt a little to peel it off. Easy to peel once you get it going. Just make sure you have a thick enough layer on, and it'll peel easier.",0,0
221,5,"Love the product..Can get hard to remove as it really gets stuck on your skin, but it feels as it pulls all the dirt out",0,1
222,4,It doesnt really peel off. it does in certain areas like around the edges of it but I had to wash the rest off with a towel because just water wouldnt take it off. But my face did feel clean afterwards that's why I gave it 4 stars.,0,1
223,5,"I really like this product for a few main reasons; I love the initial tingle it has when I first put it on, how quickly it dries, how easy it is to peel off, and all the funk it gets out of my pores! It has worked best after a shower to open up my pores a bit. I leaves my face smooth and feeling squeaky clean!!",0,1
224,5,"Very sticky, pulls tons of dead skin off and visibly cleans my pores. It smells pretty good too",0,1
225,5,I purchased this blackhead remover mask after doing some research and comparing other products alike. I was told that some masks will stick to your face and are very hard to peel off. I‚Äôve been using this mask for about 3 weeks now and I can say the mask is easy to peel off. I mostly use it for my nose but have done the full facial as well.,0,1
226,5,"When I started to use this product I was skeptical and was expecting it to be like other masks that I had purchased in the past. But as I started applying it to my face I can feel how much denser the liquid was, and that's when I knew this was some quality stuff. I have used it for 5 days now and I can feel how much softer and brighter my skin looks. Thank you Piero Lorenzo.",0,1
227,5,This product was recommended by a friend and she was correct! This mask works better then others I‚Äôve tried.,0,1
228,1,This is falsely advertised. The seller is bribing people to leave good reviews. It doesn‚Äôt actually pull out blackheads. It feels like Elmers Glue,1,0
229,5,"I love, love this product. Usually I use a face peal, usually charcoal. Never again! I will use Piero Lorenzo blackhead remover mask instead.",0,1
230,5,"I was hoping to the get the same results that others have reported in the comments - unfortunately, I don't think it did much to remove my blackheads. However, the ""suction"" does work well for exfoliation and removing oil.",0,1
231,5,This product really works! Make sure to apply a THIN layer of the mask and then wait until dry completely ( it might take more than 15 minutes),0,1
232,5,"I have used a similar product, except it was just pulling off tape off my face.I enjoyed the effects of green tea on my face. It was very relaxing as I waited for the mask to dry.This mask felt slightly more soothing to pull off too, and it left my face feeling very soft. I am excited to keep using it.The smells were not too strong and was pleasant.",0,1
233,4,"This mask is great for clogged pores, you can literally see blackheads and dirt from your pores on the mask once you‚Äôve peeled it off. I‚Äôve been using it for two weeks and feel like I see an improvement in my skin texture already.",0,1
234,5,"I've been using it on my nose for blackheads, it smells and feels good! No complaints",0,1
235,5,"The best suction black mask I‚Äôve ever used! You can actually see your blackheads and whiteheads come out of your pores after peeling off this suction mask! I will recommend to all my friends! Thanks Piero Lorenzo for the best suction mask I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of using! Leaves skin so smooth, refreshed, and with clearer skin!",0,1
236,4,"I liked the product itself for its cleansing effect but I was not a fan of the smell, it has a male cologne kind of smell which I did not enjoy. However, it does the job and my face felt very clean and soft after use.",0,1
237,5,I enjoyed this product very much. Works a lot better exfoliating before applying mask. A little of a stinging sensation the first two minutes. I fan my face to relive the sensation and to dry the mask a little faster. Does have a chemical smell to it like glue. I apply a good medium thick coat. Overall I like this product and will buy more soon! Trabaja muy bien!,0,1
238,5,"Great product, easy to peel off and skin was left feeling very refreshed and soft. Would recommend using the plastic applicator that is sent with it due to it being hard to get off your hands.",0,1
239,5,One of the best charcoal masks I've used. Clears blackheads really good so I use it once a week to have a clear face.,0,1
240,4,Great as a peel off face mask! Make sure you have time like at night before bed because it does take a little time for it to dry enough to peel off properly!,0,1
241,5,It will s a great peel mask. There is really no negative smell to speak of. For cleaning it does remove the dirt and feels like my face is cleaner after using it. It is a bit thick to spread so be careful of that. Overall it is a great product if your looking for a peel off mask.,0,1
242,5,I must admit I did not think this would be worth buying but my daughter really wanted to try it. I was wrong. It worked great and was fun to use. When I pealed it off I could see the white heads it had taken out of my skin. My nose looks so much better. I would recommend trying this product,0,1
243,5,My face feels amazing. Steamed it first before applying. My face is so smooth and feels great.,0,1
244,5,"I searched a lot of blackhead remover mask on amazon. At last I bought 3, this one really works. Recommended!!",0,1
245,5,Bought this for my boyfriend and has been working out great. It‚Äôs easy to put on and easy to remove. It‚Äôs definitely helped remove Blackheads without irritation.,0,1
246,2,"Didn't do much as far as cleaning my pores, but it feels neat when it dries, and is fun to peel off.",0,0
247,5,Works great and peels away easily without ripping your face off.,0,1
248,5,"My barber used this product on me one time two months ago. I been hooked ever since, so now I buy it and use at home. Removes all black heads.",0,1
249,5,"It was pretty good, and actually came off evenly. I‚Äôve only used it once, but will plan on using it again!",0,1
250,5,Arrived in good shape. My boyfriend and I tried it out together - he clean shaved his beard first. Both of us thought it cleared out our pores better than anything else we‚Äôve tried. It didn‚Äôt have a gross smell like most charcoal masks I‚Äôve tried. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY it hurt like 700% less to peel this mask off than any other similar product I‚Äôve tried!,0,1
251,5,Great product for getting our stubborn blackheads! I love using this product at least once a week to keep my skin clear,0,1
252,1,It didn‚Äôt pull a single blackhead out. I‚Äôve tried it several times... not sure why it doesn‚Äôt work for me but it doesn‚Äôt...,0,0
253,4,"This product does exactly as advertised. after using the product for just a couple of days, i could already see the changes in my face. it felt more moist and i would highly recommend this product to anyone who is interested. the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 was the size of the bottle. it looks a lot bigger in the picture than it really is.",0,1
254,2,"I thought I‚Äôd give it a try, but it dried out my face something awful. I use a moisturizer and everything. It did clean out my pores though for sure.",0,0
255,5,I don't have many blackheads around or on my nose that much but when I do I can never seem to get them to come out good enough. I searched for a long time on face masks and wiping pads but didn't find anything that I liked until I came across this product. It comes off very easily and has a great smell to it too all for a great price.,0,1
256,1,Did nothing! You could put Elmer's glue on you face and get the same results.,0,0
257,5,The product cleaned deeply and it felt awesome to pull it off with all the old skin cells and gunk along with it. It did take a bit longer to dry than the instructions said it should and my face was a bit red for a while. The redness went away and my face felt fabulous.,0,1
258,5,Love this mask! Easy to apply with applicator that is included. No mess! I had tried others and very messy! It comes off so easily! I have sensitive skin and others were painful to remove and left my skin irritated. I use it on my teenage son's face and his acne has begun to clear up. Opens up the pores! I can see it on the mask!,0,1
259,3,"For the price of the product it does a lot. It doesnt get all blackheads, but it pulls out the stuff on the surface. Although the mask doesnt get all the blackheads it helps pull the deep ones up a bit making it easier to remove.",0,0
260,5,Hurts a little in sensitive areas but over all I feel so nice after.,0,1
261,5,Very nice product. Does a great job and it feels amazing.,0,1
262,5,"This product is awesome for removing blemishes under the skin, deep cleaning your pores and pulling out any excess dirt and oil on your skin. I LOVE IT! The smell isn‚Äôt my favorite, but hey, if it works, that‚Äôs what matters most to me. Highly recommend!",0,1
263,5,"I bought this for my 12-year-old daughter who struggles with serious acne, including black heads. This product was a little runny going on, but dried right away on the face without over-drying. The best part was that it peeled off easily and did it's job of pulling out black heads.",0,1
264,5,I have been looking for products that won't irritate my skin after use and this product does exactly that!,0,1
265,5,I've used multiple black head removers and this one really gets the job done. I've applied it to my whole face every few weeks and I've noticed my pores becoming smaller each time,0,1
266,4,If you have facial hair it will pull when taking off the mask. No scent so that was good. Good for nose and chin area. Replaces the need to use the blackhead strips and is way better than the blackhead strips. Based on the tube size If you use it as a full face mask you might be able to use it 4 or 5 times max.,0,1
267,4,"Makes my skin feel good and smells great, but it doesn't really seem to have any deep suction.",0,1
268,5,"This face mask is great for sensitive and easily irritated skin! Peeling it off doesn‚Äôt leave the skin irritated. It also narrows enlarged pores in addition to removing acne. It also comes with an applicator, which is super convenient! It draws out toxins, and dirt. I've seen tremendous results using this for the past month, it's amazing!!!",0,1

270,5,I really like this product. It goes on your face good and it was really easy to remove. highly recommended for people to try and use this product.,0,1
271,5,Loved the way it made my skin feel like after wards it's a great product,0,1
272,5,"This product is easy to apply, doesn't smell, and is easy to take off. However it does not get super deep in your pores, maybe I need to steam my face more before. Note that I normally wait longer than indicated, certain parts might not dry in the time indicated, sometimes putting a thick layer will also cause it not to dry. Overall good!",0,1
273,5,I love the fact that it removes impurities but it‚Äôs not so harsh to dry out your skin. I also assumed it would hurt & pull the hairs from my skin but it was painless!! Would recommend,0,1
274,5,"An easy to peel, high quality mask that is suitable for any gender. My boyfriend loves how much this product removes impurities. Prime delivery is available (4/2020) for this product. Super convenient shipping times during quarantining for the coronavirus pandemic. There's never been a better time to engage in self care!",0,1
275,5,I bought this for my teen kid. it works for him.,0,1
276,5,"I was shocked at how much came out of pores! This smells pretty good. I didn't apply it evenly, so not all of it peeled off, but was easily removed with water. I will definitely continue using.",0,1
277,4,"You need to make sure to add a thick layer or the product won't pull out blackheads. Otherwise, if you use it correctly. It works great!",0,1
278,5,Put on a little thicker and it‚Äôs comes off easy,0,1
279,5,"I was having issues with a few blackheads , something I never had to deal with in my early life , which is why i had to run around buying multiple different products, after trying this product I was able to stop using other products , I use it once a week and it definitely does the job",0,1
280,5,Cleans well and peel easy. Skin feels good without irritation. Great quality and reasonable price.,0,1
281,1,I feel my face IS cleaner after using this product but it doesnt remove blackheads very well at all. I have other products that make my face feel as clean and got this mainly for the blackheads. False advertisement,0,0
282,5,I liked this mask a lot! A little goes a long way but you could easily build the mask on thicker if you prefer. The mask has a cooling effect that I personally like. But the best part is that it's not painful to pull off (like some others).,0,1
283,5,"Just started using this product and my face definitely looks and feels a lot smoother now, just be sure to have a warm towel and place it on your face for about 5 minutes or so to open up the pores. It's also easy to remove after letting it dry and doesn't hurt one bit so if you have a really low pain tolerance then you'll be fine.",0,1
284,5,"I love the scent of this product and how clean my skin felt after use! A great deal for how much you pay compared to the quality of the product. Only problem I encountered was if you put it on too thick in an area, it takes a really long time to dry. Other than that, so worth it!",0,1
285,5,"Smelled great. Didn‚Äôt work as well as I thought but I would recommend open your pores with a hot towel beforehand. It was easy to remove although it can take out some of your hairs. It personally wasn‚Äôt for me, but maybe the next person. After a couple uses, it definitely left my skin soft and is easy to apply",0,1
286,5,"Easy to apply and you don't need all that much, which is nice because a lot of masks I've bought only last me a short amount of time. Peeling it off is super easy! What you can't peel off you can wash off with a damp cloth, I LOVE this mask and how it can help clear up my pores:) Plus it's not crazy expensive.",0,1
287,4,"Only used twice, so I won't rate this mask too high or low as I'm still making my own conclusions. It seemed fairly effective at pulling most of the gunk out of my pores, but I'm not sure how much I could tell a difference the next day. Will continue to use, though, as the price is right and it seems to do what it advertises!",0,1
288,5,Amazing product! Smooth and easily applied. Does not hurt or uncomfortable when taking it off. Very great for the amount!,0,1
289,5,Best peel-off mask for the value. Removes blackheads as you peel it off. Will repurchase.,0,1
290,5,This mask is perfect for occasionally cleaning out your pores. It is not painful at all and you can see the stuff it pulls out after peeling it off. I have sensitive skin and it has not irritated my skin whenever I have used it. It has a cooling sensation when applied that I enjoy. I have nothing bad to say about this mask.,0,1
291,5,Makes your face very soft and cleans the pores! Definitely want to keep it away from your hairline as it will pull the hair out if you‚Äôre not careful.,0,1
292,5,"I was very pleased with this product. It was in clean packaging. The product did what it said it would do and had a nice aroma, which was just an added bonus.",0,1
293,5,Overall worked as intended . I made the mistake of place the mask all over my face and it was painful to take off. I would suggest using it on just your t zone area.,0,1
294,5,This was the first time buying a mask like this for me. It was easy to apply. A little difficult taking it off as it was hard to get an edge to start peeling it. Once started peeling it comes off in mostly one sheet. The black mask leaves the skin feeling soft and clean.,0,1
295,5,Helped to clear pores and get the oil out.,0,1
296,5,"I love this product. Its a nice peel off mask , leaves your skin super fresh and smooth. I have a strawberry nose and i cannot say it 100 percent helped me get rid of my blackheads , but it sure did help to some level.I just loved how it make my skin after the first use",0,1
297,5,We have tried many blackhead remover masks before and this product not only smells good but it super easy to apply with the included applicator. We use it about 2x a month in addition to our normal skincare regimen and our skin is noticeably softer and cleaner after peeling this mask off.,0,1
298,5,"Product had a bit of a cooling effect not sure if contains mint of some sort. Overall the product did what it was supposed to, I did see blackheads come out.",0,1
299,5,"Im actually trying it as I write this so I haven't had the chance to peel it yet; however, I can see the junk in my pores popping out into the mask which is pretty cool. Packaging was easy, came with an applicator.",0,1
300,5,"This black head pore mask is nice, it has a cooling feeling great for relaxing and it was an easy to apply and easy to remove, of course it not a crazy pull your skin type but it pulls enough of dead skin I love it, will order again forsure.",0,1
301,5,Worked as described. Not great at removing the deep black heads but works well with superficial acne.,0,1
302,5,OMG really sucks out black heads,0,1
303,5,Works great pulls the funk out!,0,1
304,1,"No suction! Takes for ever to dry, or doesnt dry at all.",0,0
305,3,Easy to use and remove. I‚Äôm not really seeing results. Bior√© pore strips work better for me.,0,0
306,4,Product did not have a harsh smell which was really good and was also easy to peel off not like the videos you see of people almost ripping their face off. However I dont think it really did anything for blackheads. Was still an inexpensive fun thing for girls night.,0,1
307,5,This product seems to really work on pulling out blackheads and whiteheads and after using a few times my son could really tell a difference in his skin. It is easy to pull off if you get it on thick enough. Great product for the price!,0,1
308,4,Didn't work as well as I hoped,0,1
309,5,This made my skin look good. It was smooth and no black heads.,0,1
310,5,I was this product for removal and blackheads. The product worked good the first time for removal of blackheads but did not work the second time it was used. Make sure you only leave the product on for the recommended amount of time. Very difficulty removing if leaving on too long.,0,1

314,5,Great for large pores and smells good!,0,1
315,3,Great product but only enough for about 3 face masks,0,0
316,5,I dint expect this will give feather touch velvety skin. I tried in small area of my face. Yo make my skin sensitive to it. I dint get any irritation. I tried it on husbands faces as well. Even in first application it gave a massive result. I will buy it again.,0,1
317,5,I have used a lot of black masks and it seems like all I have tired has never worked good. But this black mask is great. I can see my white heads being pulled to the service every time I uses it. It also makes my face nice and smooth. Easy pilling it off and the sent is not over powering. Great black mask.,0,1
318,5,"Worked well. Was fun to peel off. Kinda hurt when I didn't shave before use, so keep that in mind. Crazy how much it bonds to your skin.",0,1
319,5,Works pretty good but make sure to let it dry completely for easy peel,0,1
320,5,Love it!!! Great mask!!!,0,1
321,5,I really enjoyed the black mask. It pulled out things in places no one should know about.,0,1

323,5,It's a great addition to my weekend spa day routine. There is no bad odor and it dries quickly. Even my husband uses it. It applies thick and sticky. Be careful of any drips if you apply it too thick.,0,1
324,5,I only used it once and I‚Äôll use it again. After using it my skin was softer.What I really like is the fact it didn‚Äôt dry my skin.It was a little painful( not so bad) to take it out though.,0,1
